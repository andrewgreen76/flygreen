DHCP WITH dnsmasq
===================================================================================

 . The machine that runs the DHCP server is to have a static address.
 . This address is to be configured into the network interface settings of the OS.
 . This ensures "reliable lease assignment and client connectivity".


Reconfiguring dnsmasq with different client and server interfaces:
  |
  $ sudo dnsmasq -C [path_to_config]    # Forces the utility to listen to the specified config instead of its own at
					# /etc/dnsmasq.conf .


Deploying a DHCP client with dnsmasq:
  |
  $ sudo dhclient -i [client_interface] -v    # how you run a DHCP client 
  # ... since the dnsmasq server is already running and can take on DHCP queries.
