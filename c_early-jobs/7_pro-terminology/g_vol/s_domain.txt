In computing, "domain-specific" refers to tools, languages, or applications that are tailored to address the needs and requirements of a particular area of expertise or industry, known as a domain. These solutions are designed with the specific tasks, data structures, and workflows of that domain in mind, often providing specialized features and optimizations that are not found in general-purpose tools.
