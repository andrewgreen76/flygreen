How does this one come up with a memory address ?
Is it a relative memory address ? (Memory protection ?)
Is it the kernel that comes up with the absolute memory address ?
  How does it map the abs_mem_addr to rel_mem_addr ?
Kernel's memory manager module <~> loader (post-linker) 


========================================================================================
      	   absolute address 	   relative address
	   
 . DS
 . BSS
 . SS
 . heap
========================================================================================


Static memory allocation :
 . data segment
 . BSS 


Dynamic memory allocation - STACK vs. HEAP :
 |
 . we want local variables of fixed size , scope , and lifetime 
 . [stack] x [var_init in ds (not ss) IN ASSEMBLY , bind to label]
 |  . the compiler generates the assembly code to do that
 |
 . we want variables of unknown/variable size 
 . [heap] x [ malloc() , free() ]
    . the compiler generates the assembly code to do that
