/*

1) I copied the MLFQ implementation from one of the preceding lesson modules (the copy-and-paste affair) and it turns out that the mlfq_scheduling function is missing a closing brace ... though the code passed when I was going through the lesson module on MLFQ. Must be that the checker simply checks for the copypasta, letting through the bug they put in the segments. Go figure. 


2) Obviously, the MLFQ implementation in its early iteration is missing the print statements for the average times. So put those there. 


3) The "enqueued" and "dequeued" print statements clearly must be removed or at least commented out. 


4) We don't even know what the quanta are for every priority level queue, do we? If it's really 2 for the high, 4 for the medium, and 8 for the low, then how on earth did the first process with the duration of 10 finish within the first slice (without getting rescheduled)? How did it get completed before the second process?
