DATA JOURNALING : 
============================================================================================

Pre-emptive measures taken in the interest of data integrity and recovery.
 |
 . rolling back - reverting the target data blocks to the old state
 . replaying	- updating the target data blocks to the new state 


Copying file changes to the journal (before committing the changes to the file system).
 |
 . fast
 . atomic (all or none of the changes are applied) 


struct journal {
  + initial block 
     . final addresses of blocks involved
     . TID - transaction identifier
  + content blocks
     . content before (over)writing to the disk 
  + final block
     . w/ TID 
};
