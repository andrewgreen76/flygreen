DNS ZONE FILES
===================================================================================

ZONE FILE : 
 . a file used to configure a single DNS zone with relevant resource records (of type A) 
 . must have an SOA (state of authority) resource declaration
    . a resource record matching a DNS zone with the name server responsible for it
 . NS records that might end up functioning the same way as SOA records 


Reverse lookup zone file :
 . when a client provides an IP address, a reverse lookup zone file will have the DNS reciprocate with an FQDN
     right away 
 . holds "pointer resource record declarations"
 . a single pointer record maps an IP address backwards - to the respective domain name (FQDN)
 . "for logging, authentication, or security verification purposes"
 . "Reverse DNS [querying caters to security] by allowing systems [mail servers, firewalls, and intrusion detection
    systems] to verify that an IP address maps to a legitimate domain name, aiding in spam filtering, access control,
    and anomaly detection."
