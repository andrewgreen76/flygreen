Devices with multiple physical CPUs are common in modern computing systems, especially in servers, high-performance computing clusters, and certain workstations. Here are a few examples of devices that may feature multiple physical CPUs:

1. **Server Systems:**
   - Enterprise-level servers often come with multiple physical CPUs to handle the computational demands of running numerous concurrent processes and serving a large number of clients. Examples include:
     - Dell PowerEdge servers
     - HP ProLiant servers

2. **Workstations for High-End Computing:**
   - Workstations designed for tasks such as 3D rendering, scientific simulations, and content creation may include multiple physical CPUs. These systems are built for high-performance computing. Examples include:
     - BOXX APEXX workstations
     - Lenovo ThinkStation P Series

3. **Supercomputers:**
   - Supercomputers are designed for extremely high-performance computing and scientific research. They often feature a massive number of CPUs and GPUs. Examples include:
     - IBM Summit
     - Cray XT5

4. **Data Center Clusters:**
   - Data centers deploy clusters of servers with multiple physical CPUs to handle diverse workloads efficiently. Cloud service providers use such configurations to offer scalable and flexible computing resources. Examples include:
     - Amazon EC2 instances with multiple vCPUs
     - Google Cloud Compute Engine instances with multiple virtual CPUs

5. **High-End Gaming PCs:**
   - Some high-end gaming PCs or gaming workstations may come with multiple physical CPUs, especially those built for content creators and gamers who engage in resource-intensive tasks. Examples include custom-built gaming rigs with dual CPUs.

6. **Research Computing Clusters:**
   - Research institutions and universities may deploy computing clusters with multiple physical CPUs to support scientific research, simulations, and data analysis. Examples include custom-built research clusters using Intel Xeon or AMD EPYC processors.

It's important to note that while some devices have multiple physical CPUs, many consumer-grade computers, laptops, and smaller-scale systems typically have a single CPU or a multicore processor. The examples provided above represent scenarios where the computational demands justify the use of multiple physical CPUs.
