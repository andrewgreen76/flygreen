"
Diffusion doping and ion implantation are two fundamentally different techniques for introducing dopant atoms into
  silicon—diffusion uses high-temperature gas or solid sources to drive atoms thermally into the lattice, while ion
  implantation accelerates ionized dopant atoms directly into the silicon—but in modern CMOS processes they are
  often used together (implantation for precise shallow doping + high-temperature diffusion/anneal steps to activate
  and distribute the dopants).
