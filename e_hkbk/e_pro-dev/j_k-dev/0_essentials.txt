WHAT IS AN OPERATING SYSTEM ? 
========================================================================================

 . NOT a program
 . it is a software suite comprised of :
   . the kernel - itself being a program 
   . build utilities : 
     . compiler
     . assembler
     . linker 
   . other utilities : 
     . debugger 


========================================================================================
WHAT IS A KERNEL ? 
========================================================================================

 . the central program of an operating system 
 . in charge of :
   . virtualizing concurrent execution of multiple jobs/tasks at the same time 
   . has to use a scheduling algorithm to figure out when to start or resume running a task amidst other tasks
   . minimizing idling time , thereby maximizing efficiency / use of resources 
   . security : has to determine whether a process is malicious or not 


========================================================================================
WHAT IS A KERNEL DRIVER ? 
========================================================================================

A protected-mode substitute for a BIOS service : 
 . for interfacing with hardware , I/O in particular (disk , peripherals , NIC) 

"
A kernel driver is a specific type of software component that operates in kernel space, allowing the operating system to interact with hardware devices, manage resources, and provide an interface for user-space applications to access hardware functionality.

========================================================================================
WHAT IS A JOB ? 
========================================================================================

 . a.k.a. a task
 |
 . a queued program
 . a user request
 ~ a process 


========================================================================================
WHAT IS A PROCESS ? 
========================================================================================

 . a program currently being run
 ~ a job 
 . interestingly enough , even when in waiting (queued) or ready state ,
     it may still be called a process 


========================================================================================
A LAUNDRY LIST OF ITEMS RELATED TO KERNEL OPERATIONS : 
========================================================================================

io handling / fileOps
memgmt
proc sched / mgmt
int handlers, bottom halves
time mgmt / timers
sci
page cache
vfs
kernel sync & locking
portability
dbg tchqs


========================================================================================
WHAT IS A KERNEL MODULE ? 
========================================================================================

"
The kernel needs a module for extending its functionality without requiring a complete recompilation, allowing for the addition of features such as device drivers, filesystem support, and other enhancements dynamically at runtime.
