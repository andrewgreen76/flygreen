Since processes cannot share translations from the same TLB , they should be distinguished from one another.
. The ASID (address-space identifier) field serves as an extension to the TLB cache.
. Every process has its own ASID.
. That way the TLB doesn't have to be flushed for every subsequent process (setting all valid bits to 0).
  Same TLB misses will not be re-introduced.
. CONCLUSION : TLB miss overhead is reduced.

. The kernel stores the process ASID in a privileged register to inform the hardware which process is currently running.



Sharing pages between processes cuts the physical memory uptake overhead.
