INTERRUPTS ARE FOR SYSTEM-SPECIFIC SERVICES :

Yes, in x86 architecture, aside from `int 0x80`, there are several other interrupts and software interrupts. Here are some of the commonly used ones:

1. **`int 0x10`** - Video services: Used for video operations such as setting the video mode and screen attributes (BIOS interrupt for video).

2. **`int 0x13`** - Disk services: Provides access to disk operations like reading from and writing to disk sectors (BIOS interrupt for disk operations).

3. **`int 0x14`** - Serial communication: Handles serial port communications (BIOS interrupt for serial port operations).

4. **`int 0x15`** - System services: Includes services like memory size detection and extended memory services (BIOS interrupt for system services).

5. **`int 0x16`** - Keyboard services: Handles keyboard input operations (BIOS interrupt for keyboard).

6. **`int 0x17`** - Printer services: Manages printer operations (BIOS interrupt for printer).

7. **`int 0x1A`** - System timer: Provides system time services and interrupts (BIOS interrupt for system clock).

8. **`int 0x21`** - DOS services: In real mode, this interrupt is used to invoke various DOS functions (used by DOS and early Windows).

9. **`int 0x80`** - Linux system calls: Used to invoke system calls in the Linux kernel (in 32-bit x86 mode).

10. **`int 0x81` to `int 0xFF`** - Reserved for various uses, including user-defined software interrupts and extended system services.

These interrupts provide various services and access to hardware or system functionality, depending on the mode (real mode, protected mode, etc.) and the operating system in use.
