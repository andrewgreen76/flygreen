Is there a Bash command that can tell me what the resolution of the display on my device is?
ChatGPT

Yes, you can use the xrandr command in Bash to get information about the display and its resolution. xrandr is a command-line utility for configuring and querying display settings in X Window System.

To get the resolution of the display, you can run the following command:

bash

xrandr | grep -w connected | awk '{print $3}'

This command uses xrandr to display information about the connected displays. The output is then filtered using grep to find the line containing the word "connected" (assuming you want the resolution of the connected display). Finally, awk is used to extract the resolution value from the output.

Running this command should display the resolution of your display, such as "1920x1080" or "1366x768". The resolution may vary depending on your specific display configuration.

Is there an equivalent of that for a Linux system with Wayland?
ChatGPT

In a Linux system running Wayland, you can use the swaymsg command to query information about the display and its resolution. swaymsg is a command-line tool for interacting with the Sway window manager, which is commonly used with Wayland.

To get the resolution of the display in a Wayland system, you can run the following command:

bash

swaymsg -t get_outputs | jq -r '.[].current_mode | "\(.width)x\(.height)"'

This command uses swaymsg to retrieve information about the connected outputs. The output is then parsed using jq, a lightweight command-line JSON processor, to extract the width and height values from the current_mode object.

Running this command should display the resolution of your Wayland display, such as "1920x1080" or "1366x768". The resolution may vary depending on your specific display configuration. Note that the jq tool is required for parsing the JSON output, so you may need to install it if it's not already available on your system (sudo apt install jq on Ubuntu-based systems).

Running this command in the Bash terminal of my Linux Ubuntu issues the following: "00:00:00.008 [swaymsg/main.c:419] Unable to retrieve socket path". What do I do?
ChatGPT

The error message "Unable to retrieve socket path" suggests that the swaymsg command is unable to connect to the Sway window manager because it cannot find the socket file.

This error typically occurs if you are running the command outside of a running Sway session or if the Sway window manager is not installed or properly configured on your system.

To resolve this issue, make sure that you have Sway installed and running on your system. You can install Sway using the package manager for your Linux distribution. For example, on Ubuntu, you can install Sway with the following command:

bash

sudo apt install sway

Once Sway is installed, you need to log in to a Sway session before running the swaymsg command. Sway is a standalone window manager, so you may need to select it as the window manager during the login process or start a new Sway session using a display manager.

After successfully logging in to a Sway session, you should be able to run the swaymsg command without encountering the "Unable to retrieve socket path" error.
