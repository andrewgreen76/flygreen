MAINSTREAM LOGIC FAMILIES
===================================================================================

Low-power Schottky TTL family:
 . TTL = transistor-transistor logic
 . a.k.a. LS TTL
 . uses BJTs
 . "for faster switching speeds (around 9 ns) at moderate power (1–2 mW per gate)"
 . "The Apple II primarily used the 74LS series of Low-Power Schottky TTL logic family for its digital circuitry,
    including the CPU, memory, and peripheral interfaces."
 . "IBM PC compatibles primarily used the 74LS (Low-Power Schottky TTL) logic family in early models (like the
    original 1981 IBM PC), transitioning to 74F (Fast TTL) and 74HC (High-Speed CMOS) in later 386/486-era systems
    for improved speed and power efficiency."


High-speed CMOS family:
 . CMOS = Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor
 . a.k.a. HC
 . uses MOSFETs
 . "for lower power consumption (0.1–0.5 mW per gate at 100 kHz) with comparable speed (8–10 ns at 5 V)
 . better noise immunity"


"Use LS (Low-Power Schottky TTL) in projects requiring 5 V TTL compatibility, high fan-out, and moderate speed with
 legacy systems (e.g., retro computing or industrial controls), and use HC (High-Speed CMOS) in battery-powered,
 low-power, or mixed-voltage (2–6 V) modern designs needing noise immunity and minimal quiescent current."


"Modern systems like the AMD Ryzen 7 use advanced CMOS logic families (such as 7 nm or 5 nm FinFET-based processes) integrated directly into the CPU die, with no discrete TTL or HC logic chips, relying instead on on-chip high-speed, low-power CMOS for all digital operations."


"... you can power LS (TTL) and HC (CMOS) chips from the same 5 V Vcc and common ground, but you must ensure the LS
outputs meet HC input voltage requirements or use pull-ups/level compatibility where needed."
