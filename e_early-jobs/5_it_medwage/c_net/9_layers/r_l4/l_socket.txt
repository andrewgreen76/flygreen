[refresher] Port : 
 . a specific number that represents a specific process/function 
 . a value (1) in the memory of the communicating process and (2) in the packets 
 . a value used for multiplexing (funneling) and demultiplexing (distribution between processes)

TCP SOCKETS
===================================================================================

Instantiation : 
 . implementation of something remote locally (no matter the context)


Socket :
 |
 . PROCESS WITH A BUFFER for "virtual presence of the other side" 
 . the OS is in charge of **binding every socket** with a specific [IP address:port]
 => the socket can use the IP address and the port to send and receive segments 
 . has its own "socket number" notation : [IP address:port] ; xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:xx
 |
 . "instantiation of one endpoint on the other endpoint in a TCP connection"
 . TCP sockets can only be instantiated by processes 
 . opening a socket = instantiating a socket


Jargon : 
 . we say that “traffic can be sent to a port”
 . we say that “a socket has to be opened on the node’s port for the other node to get a response”
