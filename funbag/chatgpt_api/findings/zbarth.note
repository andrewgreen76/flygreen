What does Zach Barth do for a living now?
Zach Barth is a video game designer and programmer who is best known as the founder of Zachtronics, an independent video game development studio. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, Zach Barth was still the CEO and lead designer at Zachtronics.

Zachtronics has developed and released several critically acclaimed puzzle games, including SpaceChem, Infinifactory, and Opus Magnum, among others. The studio is known for its focus on open-ended puzzle-solving, as well as for its distinctive visual style and engaging gameplay mechanics.

It's worth noting that Zach Barth is a private individual, and so there may not be much publicly available information about his current work beyond what is already known about Zachtronics.
