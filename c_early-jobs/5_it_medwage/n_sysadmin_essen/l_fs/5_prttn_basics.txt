PARTITIONS
===================================================================================

 . To format the disk or a part of it you need to create a partition (a bounded space) on it.
 . Once the partition is created, you can ***mount*** an OS or something with a different function to it.
 . Volume : a partition formatted to a certain FS.
 . Volume label : name given to the storage drive


PARTITION TABLE:
 . holds info on the partitioned structure of the disk
 . classifies every partition as {boot (OS), swap, ...}
 . shows amount of space allocated for every partition
 . ...
Partition table SCHEMES - determine the structure of partition info.
 (a) master boot record (MBR)
    . the older method
    . used for Windows OS
    . max vol size = 2TB
    . allows for up to four ***primary partitions**
    . primary partitions can be divided into ***extended partitions***
    . extended partitions can be divided into ***logical partitions***
 (b) GUID partition table (GPT)
    . necessary for setting up UEFI
    . over 2TB of space
    . unlimited number of partitions of the same type
GUID (Globally Unique Identifier):
 . "a 128-bit value used to uniquely identify objects, components, or entities across systems and networks
    without duplication"
 . should remind of the IPv6 addresses
