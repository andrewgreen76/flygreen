Wall sockets :
 . 120 V (will give a cardiac arrest) 
 . ~15 A 
 . need medium-impedance electro-protective rubber gloves


Wall adapter :
 . ~1200 W 


Amperage drop : 
 . amperage drops in a closed DC circuit due to internal impedance 


Service integrity :
 . choose the more expensive multimeter over a cheap wall adapter with its inaccurate measurements
