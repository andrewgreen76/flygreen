WAYS OF MANAGING PROCESSES
===================================================================================

Communicating with processes - using signals: 
 . signal : something sent to inform a process that an event has happened
 . e.g., an interrupt, a manual SIGTERM, etc.


Aborting a process: 
 . It is totally fine to abort a time-consuming process thatâ€™s only moving data around in memory - just as long as:
    1. it has nothing to do with data on a disk, and
    2. it is not a system-critical process.
