COPPER CABLES - TECHNOLOGIES 
===================================================================================

General :
 . four pairs of color-coded twisted copper wires
 . each pair : one solid and one striped

Unshielded twisted pair (UTP)
 . the most common
 . least expensive
 . in business and home networks
 . some protection against EMI, RFI, and crosstalk interference. 

Shielded twisted pair (STP)
 . where EMI, RFI, and crosstalk are quite problematic
 . "uses a BRAIDED ALUMINUM AND/OR COPPER SHIELDING to encase the four twisted pairs underneath the outer jacket" 

Foiled twisted pair (FTP)
 . where EMI, RFI, and crosstalk are quite problematic
 . "uses A THIN FOIL SHIELD that wraps around the bundle of twisted pair wires underneath the outer jacket" 


 . "The STP and FTP labels are often used interchangeably to reference shielded and/or foiled cables."


Cabling for high-interference environments : 
 . A shielded with foiled twisted pair (SF/FTP) :
    . STP and FTP can be combined for greater protection
 . each of the twisted pairs can have its own shielding , but that will make the cable more expensive
