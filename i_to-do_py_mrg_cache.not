  - a better prompt for username (can't have whateverdefaultmeans@gmailuser@gmail.com) 
- internships 
- SMTH PROFESSIONAL to/with SOMETHING YOU HAVE :
  - focus on Emacs, Bash, Ubuntu. 
  - reporting bugs , typos 
  - skillfully written documentation

Interview script - something to say to the interviewer :
- No portfolio - Why ?
  - START MAKING SACRIFICES 
  - Still growing my skills
  - Can't find relevant and actionable projects to work on (no bugs to report)
    - Technical complications (limitations like no Pop_OS!) 
- What took so long ?
  - Moving + getting local residence squared away.
  - Still studying : Coursera.
- Why this job ?
  - Underqualified for openings when matchmaking.

statically typed - determined/accessible at compile-time
dynamically typed - accessible during runtime. 
objects :
- structs :
  - organization,
  - (using ptrs to build and manip. data structures - not to be confused with structs)
    - data structures retain node organization
    - data structures retain their own organization
    - data structures help us use memory economically (keep us away from memory bottlenecking) 
- (unions) 
ptrs :
- problems w/o ptrs:
  - tying objects together to make structures
- purpose:
  - dyn.memgmt,
  - distant recall
  - aliasing ("I hate having to write the long identifier for the same object")
