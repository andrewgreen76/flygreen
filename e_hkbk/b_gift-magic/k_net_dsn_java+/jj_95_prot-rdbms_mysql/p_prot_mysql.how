MySQL primarily uses the MySQL Protocol for client-server communication. The MySQL Protocol is a proprietary protocol developed specifically for MySQL and is optimized for efficient data transfer and query execution between client applications and the MySQL server.

The MySQL Protocol is based on a client-server architecture, where client applications, such as web applications or command-line tools, communicate with the MySQL server to perform various database operations, including querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data.

The protocol uses a TCP/IP connection as the underlying transport layer. It operates on the default MySQL port, which is 3306. When a client application establishes a connection to the MySQL server, it sends commands and queries in the form of text-based messages to the server, and the server responds with the requested data or status information.

While the MySQL Protocol is the primary protocol used by MySQL, it's important to note that MySQL also supports other standard protocols such as the HTTP-based REST API (MySQL Shell) and the X Protocol (MySQL X DevAPI), which allow alternative ways to interact with MySQL databases. However, the MySQL Protocol remains the most widely used and traditional protocol for MySQL client-server communication.
