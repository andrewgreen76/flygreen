Malicious actor :
 . "an individual or entity that intentionally attempts to harm, exploit, or disrupt computer systems or networks"

PORTS/SERVICES AS MALICIOUS ACTORS 
===================================================================================

 . sending malware
 . scanning client ports for unsecured ports and/or vulnerabilities


Unsecured port on the client's side : 
 . does not require authentication
 . a service on that port does not have to share its identity
 => the client will unconditionally trust any service on that port , whether its a legitimate service , a malware
    sender , or impersonator 


Security :
 . "Securing a port involves using firewalls, access controls, authentication, and encryption to restrict and
    protect the data transmitted through that port."
 . we say that "we are to secure ports" , not "we are to secure sockets"
