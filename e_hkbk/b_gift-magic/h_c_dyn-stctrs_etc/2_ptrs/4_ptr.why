What is a pointer:

===================================================================================

What is a pointer: 

a variable 
holds value = address of another var
What for? How is it used?  


How does a machine know whether what it's looking at in the memory is a var? 



What's a pointer good for:

var aliasing	 // make a short alias for a long name in a local scope. 
?? remembering a file/dir, but not by the path ??
taste : head, linked list
Anything else ? 



Pointers are used in a professional work environment to efficiently manipulate and manage memory, facilitate data structures and algorithms, enable dynamic memory allocation, and optimize performance in low-level programming tasks.
