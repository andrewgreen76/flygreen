FS PARTITION RECOVERY IN WINDOWS
===================================================================================

Journaling:
 . Anything that changes about any file is reflected in not just the metadata, but also ***the NTFS log file***.
 . This is how we keep track of the file system’s current state.
 . This log is used for system recovery.


Self-healing:
 . a background process that automatically remedies various issues like data corruption
 > fsutil repair query [drive letter:]    # for monitoring self-healing on a disk


NTFS’ “chkdsk” utility:
 |
 . for checking the health of a disk by looking for corrupted locations and other anomalies
 . will always give a report but by default it will not perform any kind of recovery action
 |
 . “chkdsk” is deployed automatically by the OS whenever it detects an issue like (a) incomplete (corrupted) data
 |  or (b) a location on the disk that is hard to read from/write to.
 |    
 |   . The volume itself has its own metadata file with a special bit that, once raised, will signal chkdsk that
 |     there is an issue. The utility will check this bit at boot time and, if the bit is set, use the NTFS log
 |     to restore the file system’s pre-crash state, thus performing the recovery.
 |
 . manually: chkdsk is used as an option of last resort in the event of some disk failure disaster
 |
 . Getting “chkdsk” to fix a problem:
   > chkdsk /F [drive letter:]    # the utility will attempt to fix any issue it finds
