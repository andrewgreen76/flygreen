NETWORKING DEVICES : 
===================================================================================

    Hub : 
    - legacy tech (for the reasons below) 
    - layer 1 device (does not need a protocol and runs point independently) 
    - allows for connecting multiple computers to communicate at once 
    - the sender device will transmit data to all hub-connected devices ; every individual recipient device will decide whether that data was meant for it
    
    network segment : a part of a LAN where devices share the same connection or packet-routing device
    
    COLLISION DOMAIN : a network segment - a (hub-unified) part of LAN - where only one device can send data at a time ; otherwise, packets can come in conflict if sent simultaneously 
    - in the event of a conflict with a different packet, the client will have to send the request again
    - timing every transmission would have to be enforced
    => this slows down the LAN 
    - basically , A LAN WITH THROUGHPUT of the same data/packet WITH DISTRIBUTION OVERHEAD
    
    Switch : 
    - allows for NODE-TO-NODE transfer of packets 
    - does so by reading the packet and “switching” it in the right direction 
    - collision domains are culled and simultaneous transmissions are allowed 
    - layer 2 device (needs the Ethernet or the Wi/Fi protocol)
    
    Router
    - layer 3 device (needs the IP protocol) 
    - stores internal tables with routing info and rules 
    - home / small office routers : they direct requests out through the wider LAN 
    - core (ISP) routers : more “central” to the Internet , forming its “backbone” , they are capable of handling more traffic 
    - Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) - a protocol that routers follow to learn about each other and thus optimize paths for future transmissions
