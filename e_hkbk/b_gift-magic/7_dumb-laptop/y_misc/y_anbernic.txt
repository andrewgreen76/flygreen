ANBERNIC gaming handheld consoles typically use various ARM-based System on Chip (SoC) solutions for their microcontroller units (MCUs) or microprocessor units (MPUs). These SoCs often integrate CPU, GPU, and other components into a single chip, providing sufficient processing power for gaming and multimedia applications.

Some common SoCs found in ANBERNIC gaming handheld consoles include:

1. Allwinner: ANBERNIC devices have used Allwinner SoCs such as the Allwinner A33, A64, or H3, which are commonly used in low-cost Android-based devices.

2. Rockchip: Another popular choice is Rockchip SoCs, like the Rockchip RK3326 or RK3326Y, known for their performance and power efficiency.

3. MediaTek: Some ANBERNIC consoles may feature MediaTek SoCs, such as the MediaTek MT8163 or MT6580, which offer a balance of performance and affordability.

These SoCs are often paired with dedicated graphics processing units (GPUs) to enhance gaming performance and provide smooth visuals. Additionally, ANBERNIC consoles typically run customized firmware or operating systems tailored for gaming emulation and multimedia playback.
