A CPU is a chip that simply takes in input, crunches it, and provides an output.
- takes in an instruction (and other inputs like a memory address, a reset bit, etc.)
- performs an operation based on the current instruction, past input, and its own inner workings
- provides an output (a word of DATA, a memory ADDRESS, next instruction to carry out, the bit to write to memory, etc.)

Yes, all CPUs are microprocessors, but not all microprocessors are CPUs. The terms "CPU" (Central Processing Unit) and "microprocessor" are often used interchangeably, but they do have slightly different meanings.

A CPU is a specific component of a computer that is responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations. It is the primary unit that carries out the actual processing of data and instructions in a computer system. CPUs are typically found in desktop and laptop computers, servers, and other computing devices.

On the other hand, a microprocessor is a more general term that refers to a small integrated circuit (IC) that contains all the basic components of a CPU on a single chip. Microprocessors are the building blocks of CPUs and serve as the central processing unit in most modern computers. They are designed to execute instructions and process data, just like CPUs.

In summary, every CPU is a microprocessor because it is a processor on a microchip. However, the term "microprocessor" can also encompass other types of processors that may not be traditional general-purpose CPUs. For example, microcontrollers and digital signal processors (DSPs) are also types of microprocessors, but they are designed for specific tasks and may not have the same level of general-purpose computing capabilities as a CPU.
