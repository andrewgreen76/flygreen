- It appears that my Ubuntu likes Qt better than it does Kdevelop, which (ostensibly)
  is good for a system like Manjaro. So I guess I'll have to try Qt instead. Note to self.

- python3 does not handle variable/object globalization the way a traditional compiler does.

- There seems to be a plethora of system call conventions in total. [OS] x [ISA] x [syscall convention] x [ASM syntax]
  would dictate how to write even a very basic program like "Hello, world". 


    Side note:
    - a crazy idea: writing a tutorial game that teaches C with a direction towards Linux kernel development.

    More thoughts:
    - I'm trying to grow my skills, but perhaps the skillset is getting "too broad" and I'm supposed to have
      a specialty, something to excel at. Which is it going to be - kernel development or making adventure
      games (ideally with a crude graphic look)? ...
      
        (A) Kernel: Well, from the professional point of view and judging by all the research that I've
	    gathered, learning kernel development is for people who are looking to become sysadmins, and from
	    watching those YouTube videos it appears to be a rather painful, miserable position to hold. ...
	    ... Damn. ... But it seems like it would be easier to find work in that field. EDIT: Oh, wait, ...
	    I could be a kernel dev for hire and actually be able to afford to do this full time. Totally
	    forgot. I'm a fucking idiot. 
	(B) Games: But if I seek to become a game developer, people would want something in 3D and for
	    VR/XR/MR/AR/whateverR as well as "jewelcase projects" (read: mobile gaming). It would be hard
	    to find work that has to do with very simple adventure games.

      OK, I think I've just solved the same problem again after having forgotten the solution. ... Fooh!
