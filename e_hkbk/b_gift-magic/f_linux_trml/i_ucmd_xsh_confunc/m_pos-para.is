Executable scripts and custom/manually defined commands, just like traditional commands, can accept arguments.


`$1` is a positional parameter in Bash. It represents the first command-line argument passed to a script or function. Positional parameters are numbered from 1 to 9, where `$1` corresponds to the first argument, `$2` corresponds to the second argument, and so on.
