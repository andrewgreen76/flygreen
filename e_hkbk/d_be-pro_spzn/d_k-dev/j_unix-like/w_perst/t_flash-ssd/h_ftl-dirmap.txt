FTL - DIRECT MAPPING ISSUES : 
===========================================================================================

Direct mapping :
 . every physical page is represented (i.e., directly mapped to) a logical page at the interface.
 . a.k.a. block-level mapping 


Deterrents :
 |
 . buffer-erase-reprogram routine cycle for every re-write 
   => performance overhead
   => longenvity issue
 - overwriting of the logical block forces overwriting of the same physical block 
 - wear leveling is not very reliable 
 - write amplicication
 |
 => slow
 => inconsistent
