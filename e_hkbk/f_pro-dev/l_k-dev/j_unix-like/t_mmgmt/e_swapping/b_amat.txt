Average Memory Access Time (AMAT) :

. AMAT = t_mem.axs + t_dsk.axs * prob_miss
. 0 < prob_miss < 1

. "Note that you must always pay the cost of accessing data in memory; ... " 
  . "... if you miss, you must also pay the cost of getting data from disk."
|

. "The cost of disk access in modern systems is so high that even a small miss rate can quickly overwhelm the overall AMAT of running processes." 
  . "We must either avoid as many misses as possible or run at the diskâ€™s speed."
