Do professional cybersecurity experts have to know and understand every single protocol?

Professional cybersecurity experts do not necessarily need to know and understand every single protocol in existence. The field of cybersecurity is broad and encompasses various domains, including network security, application security, cryptography, incident response, risk management, and more.

While having a solid understanding of common protocols like TCP/IP, UDP, ICMP, HTTP, DNS, and others is essential for network security professionals, it is not feasible to expect expertise in every protocol, especially given the vast number of protocols in use today.

Cybersecurity experts typically focus on understanding the protocols and technologies relevant to their specific areas of expertise. They may specialize in areas such as network security, web application security, cloud security, or mobile security, among others. Their knowledge and expertise are typically tailored to the specific technologies, protocols, and threats relevant to their area of specialization.

However, cybersecurity professionals should have a foundational understanding of common protocols and their security implications. This enables them to analyze network traffic, identify anomalies, detect security vulnerabilities, and mitigate risks effectively. They should also possess the ability to research and learn about new protocols as they emerge or become relevant in their field.

In some cases, organizations may have dedicated protocol experts or network engineers who specialize in the detailed understanding and analysis of specific protocols, particularly for large-scale network deployments or specialized environments. In such cases, cybersecurity experts can collaborate and consult with these specialists when needed.

Overall, while a comprehensive understanding of every single protocol is not expected, cybersecurity professionals should have a strong foundational knowledge of common protocols and stay updated on emerging protocols and technologies relevant to their area of expertise.
