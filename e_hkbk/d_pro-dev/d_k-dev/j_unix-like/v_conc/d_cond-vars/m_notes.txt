"Signaling is unquestionably necessary, but it must be more targeted. Consumers should awaken only producers, and producers should [only] awaken consumers."

Covering conditions :
 . When you have no idea which sleeping thread the live thread should wake up , cover them all with pthread_cond_broadcast(&cond).
 . Overhead :
    . extra threads are taxing on the CPU scheduler
    . they'll just wake up , re-check the condition , and resume sleep (per Mesa semantics)
    => not always a good idea ; figure something out with signal calls 
 . only appropriate in certain situations , like implementing dynamic memory allocation
