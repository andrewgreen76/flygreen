The STM32F769 microcontroller, like many other microcontrollers in the STM32 family, typically uses a parallel interface to route pixel data from memory to an LCD panel. This parallel interface is often referred to as a Flexible Static Memory Controller (FSMC) or a parallel interface controller.

The STM32F769 series microcontrollers feature a specific peripheral called the LTDC (LCD-TFT Display Controller) which is designed to interface with TFT (Thin Film Transistor) LCD panels. The LTDC can work in conjunction with the FSMC to transfer pixel data efficiently from the microcontroller's memory to the LCD panel.

The LTDC supports various display resolutions and configurations, and it can interface with different LCD panel technologies such as RGB565, RGB888, and others. It provides features like hardware layering, alpha blending, and chroma keying to enable advanced graphics rendering on the LCD panel.

In summary, the STM32F769 microcontroller typically utilizes a parallel interface via the FSMC and LTDC peripherals to route pixel data from memory to the LCD panel.
