												
Parity disk : 
 . stores pre-calculated parity bits to be matched with a next set of more recently calculated parity bits
 . used in RAID 3 and RAID 4
 |
 . otherwise , parity bits would be distributed across disks , like in RAID 5 and RAID 6 


Trade-off :
 . parity-based recovery can be used in place of mirroring-based recovery
 + save space
 + do away with cost of mirrors
 - disk replacement time 
 - persistent parity-based operations overhead - taxing on performance
