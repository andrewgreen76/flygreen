MISDIRECTED WRITES IN RAID : 
========================================================================================


Say we want to mirror a disk. 
|
|
|
It's one thing to get a good data block. It's another thing to write it to the correct sector.
  |
  . a physical identifier (ID) would accompany the data block and the checksum sector
  |  + disk no. 
  |  + block no. - offset
  |
  . block offsets don't match => misdirected write detected
     . a disk failure mode 



More redundancy could help in troubleshooting.
