The process of working reformatted pixel data in the framebuffer into timing and synchronization for display involves generating specific control signals that dictate when and how the pixel data should be sent to the display device. Here's a high-level overview of how this is typically achieved:

1. **Framebuffer Structure:**
   - The framebuffer is a dedicated area in memory that holds the complete frame of pixel data. Each pixel's color information and position within the frame are stored in the framebuffer.

2. **Timing Information:**
   - The timing information includes details such as the refresh rate, horizontal and vertical synchronization, and pixel clock. The refresh rate determines how many frames are displayed per second, while synchronization signals indicate the start and end of each line and frame.

3. **Timing Generator:**
   - A timing generator, often part of the graphics processing unit (GPU) or display controller, generates timing signals based on the specified refresh rate and resolution. This includes horizontal sync (HSYNC), vertical sync (VSYNC), and the pixel clock.

4. **Synchronization Signals:**
   - Horizontal Sync (HSYNC): Marks the beginning and end of each line.
   - Vertical Sync (VSYNC): Marks the beginning and end of each frame.

5. **Pixel Clock:**
   - The pixel clock defines the rate at which pixels are transmitted. It ensures that the pixel data is sent at the correct speed to match the display's capabilities.

6. **Data Transmission:**
   - As the pixel data is read from the framebuffer, it is transmitted serially or in parallel, synchronized with the timing signals. The synchronization signals indicate when a new line or frame is about to begin.

7. **Display Scanning:**
   - The display scans through the pixel data based on the timing signals. The horizontal sync triggers the start of each line, and the vertical sync triggers the start of each frame.

8. **Back Porch and Front Porch:**
   - The back porch and front porch are periods during which no active pixels are transmitted. They provide additional time for the display to reset and prepare for the next line or frame.

9. **Blanking Intervals:**
   - The blanking intervals, which include the horizontal and vertical blanking, are periods where no active pixels are displayed. This allows for the repositioning of the electron beam in cathode-ray tube (CRT) displays and ensures smooth transitions between lines and frames.

10. **Control Logic:**
    - Control logic in the display controller interprets the timing and synchronization signals, directing the display hardware to present the pixel data on the screen according to the specified timing.

This process ensures that the pixel data from the framebuffer is transmitted to the display in a synchronized manner, maintaining the correct spatial and temporal relationships for a coherent image. The exact details can vary based on display technology, but the general principles of timing and synchronization are fundamental to the display process.
