BUFFERING ON THE SERVER SIDE : 
========================================================================================


Servers cache and buffer their data/metadata in RAM (before writing to disk). 
  |
  + improves performance

  . server could notify the client of every successful write to RAM before the write to disk 
  - [request x+1] can arrive before [execution of x]
     . this race of operations leads to inconsistencies between [client_cache/server_RAM] and [server_disk]
     => forcing the writes : every write should be completed before letting the client know



Write-to-disk bottleneck is still a possibility.
 . there are a few solutions 
 . one solution : a faster secondary persistent storage - battery-backed memory
 . from NetApp
 . some disk-write traffic is deferred , thinning out the workload
