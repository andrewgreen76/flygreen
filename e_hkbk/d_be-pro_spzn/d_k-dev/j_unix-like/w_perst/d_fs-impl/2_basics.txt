Partition :
 = a storage volume dedicated to a file system


A simple partition organization :
 . a sequence of 8-block , 4 KB groups 
 . 1 block = 512 B 

	|	| 	    | 	   	 |	  		|								|
	|	| per-group | per-group  |	  		|	 							|
	| Super	| inode	    | data	 |			|								|
	|       | bitmaps   | bitmaps    |	inodes 		|	 		data					|
	| block | (alloc    | (alloc     | 	 		| 	(takes up most of the cylinder group space)		|
	| 	|  or free) |  or free)  | 	  		| 	 							|
	|	| 	    | 	   	 |	  		|	 							|
