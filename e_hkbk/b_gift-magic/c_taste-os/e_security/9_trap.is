=========================================================================================================================

Trap :
.  for a privileged operation to be carried out, the process must issue a special instruction called a trap to the kernel
-> the process with the trap gain the kernel mode 
-> the kernel serves the process
-> the kernel issues a return-from-trap instruction to the process
-> the process regains the user mode
|
. A trap table is used by the kernel to keep track of what code the process can, cannot, and is trying to access.
  . created at boot time



Reminder : The kernel on the RAM and the rest of the hardware work together for the sake of security.
. The kernel shares trap handlers with the hardware so that they all know what to do when a process makes a request.
