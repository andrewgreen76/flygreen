What flavor of the Assembly language has the commands "len" and "equ"?
The "len" and "equ" commands are not part of a particular flavor of Assembly language but are rather assembler directives. These directives are used to provide additional information to the assembler, which is a program that translates the Assembly code into machine code.

The "len" directive specifies the length of a data item or a block of data, and the assembler uses this information to allocate the correct amount of memory for the data.

The "equ" directive is used to define a constant or a symbol with a fixed value. The assembler replaces all occurrences of the defined symbol with the specified value during the assembly process.

Both of these directives are commonly used in many Assembly languages, including x86 Assembly, ARM Assembly, and MIPS Assembly, among others.
