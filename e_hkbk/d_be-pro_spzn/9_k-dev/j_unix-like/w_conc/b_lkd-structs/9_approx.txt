APPROXIMATION COUNTING (scenario of) :
==============================================================================================

 . several CPUs
 . a LOCAL COUNTER for every thread/CPU 
 . a shared GLOBAL COUNTER 
 . GOAL : global counter updating (adding up local counts) 
    . "Periodically or on demand, the thread-local counters are summed or combined to obtain an overall approximation of the count. This operation might involve synchronization but is less frequent than the individual updates."
 |
 . one thread per CPU => no contention => scalable counting 
 |
 => each thread/CPU works with two counters (local and global)

 . timeout of access to thread-local counter :
    . a matter of security/integrity 
    . once a local counter reaches a certain value , ...
       . the thread switches to updating the global counter instead
       . local counter is reset 

====================================================================
    . multiple threads on the same CPU - synchronized with a lock
