Hi,

My name is Andrew Green and I am a long-time graduate of the University of Nevada, Reno. I am interested in applying for an admission to UCLA. I am writing to you with a number of questions and I was wondering whether some of them should be addressed to somebody outside of your office, an individual who could function as a faculty mentor or an academic advisor.

First, below is a checklist that I have compiled from my research on the application requirements. Please let me know if anything from below is inaccurate or missing:

- Window of application for Fall 2024: Oct. 3rd, 2023 - Dec. 15th, 2023
- Three letters of recommendation - names and email addresses of recommenders (will be prompted for in the application).
- optional GRE - code 4837
- fee $135
- statement of purpose
- personal statement
- unofficial transcript
- official transcript 

Also, as I said, I have a few questions for your office or the Computer Science department. 

Question 1: I have a slightly complicated situation.

Question 2: (This one should probably go out to the CS dept.) For someone who is looking to change his academic and professional focus from games and simulation to system administration
