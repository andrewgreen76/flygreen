UNDERSTANDING QUANTUM MECHANICS - HOW SOMETHING CAN EXIST IN TWO STATES AT THE SAME TIME 
========================================================================================

"
Quantum mechanics is concerned with the probabilistic nature of quantum states and how they behave, DESCRIBING THE POTENTIAL OUTCOMES OF MEASUREMENTS RATHER THAN DETAILING THE EXACT NATURE OF REALITY AT A CLASSICAL LEVEL.
"


Quantum mechanics does not cover actual physical measurements ; that is the concern in
  classical mechanics.
  |
  |
  => quantum mechanics is purely THEORETICAL
  |
  . this is why in quantum mechanics something like a (theoretical) unit of information -
  |  - the qubit - can EXIST IN TWO STATES SIMULTANEOUSLY
  |
  . we say that something (like a qubit) will REMAIN IN TWO STATES UNTIL AN ACTUAL
  |   MEASUREMENT IS TAKEN
  |
  . when an actual measurement is taken , we say that the qubit "COLLAPSES INTO ONE OF
      THOSE TWO STATES."

Quantum computing principles are actionable as they DRIVE THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALGORITHMS AND HARDWARE THAT CAN SOLVE PROBLEMS EXPONENTIALLY FASTER than classical computers, potentially transforming industries like data analysis and drug discovery.

WHAT WE EXAMINE WITH QUANTUM MECHANICS 
========================================================================================

"
[...] quantum mechanics describes probabilities and potential outcomes rather than deterministic realities; it provides a framework for understanding HOW PARTICLES BEHAVE at a fundamental level, which can seem abstract compared to classical physics.
