CHUNK SIZE AFFECTS PERFORMANCE 
=========================================================================

 . I/O data is broken down into stripes
 . stripes are broken down into chunks
 

Stripe :
 . a group of consecutive I/O data pieces , each one written to a different disk at the same time 
 . a logical subset of I/O data 


Chunk :
 . a block , the smallest unit of I/O data
 . a logical element of a stripe , written separately to a different disk


Why is chunk size so meaningful ?
|
Imagine you want to store a file. Assume the worst-case scenario : noticeably long I/O transfer times. 
  a) You can split it into very small chunks ,
    => thereby populating more disks at the same time.
  b) You can split it into very large chunks , thereby populating fewer disks at the same time.
    => 


Positioning time = seek time + rotational delay.


 . the size of the entire data CHUNK split into stripes between multiple disks.
