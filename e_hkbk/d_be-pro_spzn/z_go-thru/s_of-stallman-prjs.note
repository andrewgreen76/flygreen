Does Richard Stallman have any Git projects of his own?



Richard Stallman, the founder of the Free Software Foundation (FSF), is known for his advocacy of free software and his contributions to the GNU Project. While he is not commonly associated with personal projects hosted on Git platforms, he has been involved in various software development projects throughout his career.

However, it's worth noting that Richard Stallman's involvement and preferences regarding specific version control systems like Git may vary. He has been a proponent of decentralized version control systems and has expressed concerns about centralized platforms like GitHub due to issues related to software freedom and control.

That being said, Stallman has contributed to various projects hosted on platforms like GitLab and GNU Savannah, which are based on Git and provide free software hosting alternatives. While these projects may not be personal projects solely attributed to Stallman, he has participated in the development and maintenance of GNU software, which is often hosted on these platforms.

If you are specifically interested in Richard Stallman's projects, I would recommend exploring the official GNU Project repository on GitLab (https://gitlab.com/gnutls) and the GNU Savannah project hosting platform (https://savannah.gnu.org/). These platforms host a wide range of free software projects, including those associated with the GNU Project that Stallman has been involved in.
