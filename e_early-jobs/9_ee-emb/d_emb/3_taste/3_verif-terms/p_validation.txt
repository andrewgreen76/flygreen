Validation in the context of FPGAs and ASICs is the process of testing the physical implementation or prototype of the design (post-synthesis for FPGAs or fabricated chip for ASICs) in real-world conditions to confirm it meets system requirements, functionality, and performance specifications, often using tools like logic analyzers or test setups.
