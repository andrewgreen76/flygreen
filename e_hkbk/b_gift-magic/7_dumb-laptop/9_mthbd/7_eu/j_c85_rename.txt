Register renaming is a technique used in modern processors to improve performance by eliminating data hazards in the pipeline. It allows the processor to map logical registers (architectural registers) to physical registers dynamically, which helps in overlapping and out-of-order execution of instructions. 

The Register Renaming Logic ensures that instructions can execute independently and concurrently, even if they use the same architectural register, by mapping them to different physical registers. This technique enhances instruction-level parallelism and enables more efficient utilization of the processor's resources.



Register renaming as a technique for improving processor performance was developed and first implemented in commercial microprocessors in the mid-1980s. One of the earliest implementations was in the IBM POWER1 architecture, which introduced register renaming to support out-of-order execution in 1990. Subsequently, other processor architectures, such as the Intel Pentium Pro (introduced in 1995), also adopted register renaming to enhance instruction-level parallelism and overall performance.
