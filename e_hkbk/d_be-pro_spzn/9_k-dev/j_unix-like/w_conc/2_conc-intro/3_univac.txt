The concept of multi-threading has evolved over time, and the term itself has been used in various contexts. However, one of the early examples of a computer system featuring a form of simultaneous or concurrent processing can be traced back to the UNIVAC I (Universal Automatic Computer I), which was one of the earliest commercially produced computers.

The UNIVAC I, designed by J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly, became operational in 1951. While it may not have had the modern concept of multi-threading as we understand it today, it did support the concept of overlapping or interleaved processing through the use of what was known as "subroutine" or "subroutine processor."

In the UNIVAC I, the main processor could execute instructions, and at the same time, a separate unit known as the "subroutine" or "special function unit" could perform additional calculations or data processing concurrently. This allowed for a certain level of parallelism or overlapping of tasks, akin to a form of multi-threading.

It's important to note that the terminology and concepts around multi-threading have evolved significantly since the early days of computing. Modern multi-threading involves the concurrent execution of threads within a single process, and this concept became more prominent with the advent of multi-core processors in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.
