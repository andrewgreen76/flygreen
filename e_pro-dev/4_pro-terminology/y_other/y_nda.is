A signed NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement) is a legally binding contract between two or more parties that aims to protect sensitive and confidential information shared between them. The agreement outlines the terms and conditions under which the parties agree not to disclose, share, or use the confidential information for any purposes beyond the scope of the agreement.

In a signed NDA, the party sharing the confidential information is referred to as the "disclosing party," while the party receiving the information is referred to as the "receiving party." The NDA typically includes details such as:

1. Definition of Confidential Information: It specifies what information is considered confidential and subject to protection under the agreement.

2. Purpose and Scope: It outlines the specific purpose for which the confidential information is being shared and the permitted uses of the information.

3. Obligations of the Receiving Party: It defines the obligations of the receiving party, such as the duty to keep the information confidential, not to disclose it to third parties, and not to use it for unauthorized purposes.

4. Exceptions: It may specify certain exceptions where the receiving party is allowed to disclose the information, such as when required by law or with the prior written consent of the disclosing party.

5. Duration: It states the length of time during which the NDA remains in effect, often referred to as the "term" or "duration."

6. Remedies: It outlines the legal remedies or consequences if either party breaches the agreement.

A signed NDA provides legal protection to parties involved in sensitive business transactions, collaborations, or any situation where confidential information needs to be shared. It is essential for safeguarding intellectual property, trade secrets, customer data, proprietary technology, or any other confidential information critical to a business's success.
