If you have the path to a file inside a directory and you want to list the contents of that directory, you can use the `dirname` command to extract the directory portion of the file path and then use `ls` to list the contents of that directory.

Here's how you can do it in Bash:

```bash
# Replace '/path/to/your/file' with the actual path to the file.
file_path="/path/to/your/file"

# Use dirname to get the directory containing the file.
directory=$(dirname "$file_path")

# Use ls to list the contents of the directory.
ls "$directory"
```

For example, if you have a file located at `/home/user/documents/report.txt`, you can list the contents of the directory `/home/user/documents` by using the above script with `file_path="/home/user/documents/report.txt"`.

This script first extracts the directory portion of the file path using `dirname`, assigns it to the `directory` variable, and then lists the contents of that directory using `ls`.
