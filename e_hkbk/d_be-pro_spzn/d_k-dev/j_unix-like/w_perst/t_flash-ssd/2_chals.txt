THE TECH OF FLASH STORAGE : 
============================================================================

 . flash chips are made of pure silicon
    => SSDs more durable/reliable than HDDs 


=================================================================================
DRAWBACKS OF FLASH-BASED STORAGE : 
=================================================================================

 - subsequent writes to THE SAME PAGE can't be close to one another 
    . due to the physical properties of transistors in NAND flash memory
    . the transistors will be worn out
    . consecutive writes can be broken up with an erase 
 - before erasing/writing to THE SAME FLASH PAGE its entire block must be erased
    . physically it would be very impractical to design and develop a mechanism
      that can erase individual tiny pages
    . (this is especially true for multi-level cell (MLC) configurations) 


Recap :
 (1) only the entire block can be erased
 (2) only an erased page can be individually programmed (written to)
 (3) to reprogram a page it must be erased (see [1])
 (.) to preserve the other pages the entire block must be buffered
