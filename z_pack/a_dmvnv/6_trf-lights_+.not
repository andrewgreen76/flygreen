Traffic lights, etc. : 
|
- watch for TURN-FORBIDDING SIGNS 
|
- not working => like a 4-way (STOP, yield)
- flashing red => like a 4-way (STOP, yield)
  - red light + turning right = stop, yield, turn 
- flashing yellow => slow down, yield, complete the move
|
(- when to make a left on red : from 1-way to 1-way, but STOP AND YIELD) 
- flashing yellow ARROW => slow down, yield, complete the turn
- green ARROW => yield, complete the turn
