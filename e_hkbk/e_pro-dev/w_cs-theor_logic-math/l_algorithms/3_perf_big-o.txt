"
In game development, using Big O notation helps optimize rendering performance by ensuring
that algorithms for collision detection operate in O(n log n) time complexity rather than
O(n^2), enhancing gameplay efficiency.

WHY BIG O 
========================================================================================

"
Big O notation is more popular than Big Theta and Big Omega because it provides an upper
bound on the asymptotic behavior of algorithms, which is often sufficient for analyzing
worst-case scenarios and establishing performance guarantees in algorithmic analysis.
