The Intel 8086, introduced in 1978, was the first Intel microprocessor to feature external controllers on the chipset. However, it's essential to note that the term "chipset" as it's understood today didn't exist in the same form back then.

The 8086 processor was typically paired with supporting chips that handled various functions such as memory interfacing, I/O operations, and bus control. These supporting chips were not integrated onto the same die as the processor but rather were separate components on the motherboard. They included components like the 8284 clock generator, 8288 bus controller, and various memory and I/O controllers.

These external controllers on the motherboard constituted an early form of chipset, although the concept wasn't as sophisticated or integrated as modern chipsets found in later processors. Nonetheless, the 8086 was the first Intel microprocessor to require external controllers on the motherboard to handle various system functions.

The Intel 8086 microprocessor was typically accompanied by several supporting chips on the motherboard, each serving specific roles or functions. These supporting chips were not integrated onto the same die as the processor but were separate components on the motherboard. Here are some of the key supporting chips often found alongside the Intel 8086:

1. 8284 Clock Generator: Generates the clock signals required for the operation of the processor and other system components.

2. 8288 Bus Controller: Controls the operation of the system bus, including address and data bus arbitration and bus timing.

3. Memory Controllers: Various memory controllers may have been used to interface with system memory, such as dynamic RAM (DRAM) or static RAM (SRAM).

4. Peripheral Controllers: These chips handle the interface between the processor and peripherals such as keyboards, displays, storage devices, and other I/O devices.

5. Interrupt Controller: Manages interrupts generated by peripheral devices, prioritizing and directing them to the appropriate interrupt service routines (ISRs).

6. DMA Controller: Direct Memory Access controller facilitates data transfers between memory and peripherals without CPU intervention, improving system performance.

7. Timer/Counter Chips: These chips provide timing and counting functions, used for tasks such as generating system clock signals, controlling intervals, or measuring time.

8. Support Chips: Various other support chips may have been used for tasks such as voltage regulation, power management, or interfacing with expansion slots.

These are some of the common supporting chips that would have accompanied the Intel 8086 microprocessor on a typical motherboard. The specific configuration could vary depending on the system requirements and motherboard design.
