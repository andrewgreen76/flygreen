RAID 0 
=========================================================================

Striping (block-level)
 |
 |
 . storing different pieces of the same data across different disks
 . every piece is written to a block (sector) on a separate disk 
 => non-redundancy 
 |
 + parallelized distribution => less time to carry out the same I/O vs. doing it with a single disk
    . T(size(tf)/N) < T(size(tf))
 + potentially saves seek time (b/c fewer blocks to R/W) 
 |
 - risk of data loss
