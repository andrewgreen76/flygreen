===================================================================================
(SECURITY) POLICIES
===================================================================================

 . Something to be discussed by the sysadmin/CSO and other leaders â€¦ rather than just one person deciding on this matter by themselves.
 . You will be the one documenting all the policies and procedures regarding the use of work devices and networks.
 
 . Methods of storing policy documentation:
    . internal Wiki
    . a file server
    . etc.
    
 . Needless to say, all work devices are to have a password on them.
 . Needless to say, all employees should have easy access to the policy documentation.
 . Whether employees are allowed to use work computers and the network for visiting websites not related to
     work ... is something in a gray area. That is up to you.
     
 . Allowing for this is a good idea if:
    . someone promotes products and services on social media
    . stays up to date on things related to their industry
    . There may be other reasons.
