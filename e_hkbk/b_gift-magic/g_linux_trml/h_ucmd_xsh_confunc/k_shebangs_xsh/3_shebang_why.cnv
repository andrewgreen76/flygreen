It's a courtesy thing. You need to put a shebang at the beginning of the script in case if this file can be copied by somebody else onto a device that may or may not have the right interpreter to run the script. (Not all shell interpreters are alike.)

Why is it important to put a shebang at the start of a script?

The shebang, also known as the hashbang or hashbang line, is a special construct at the beginning of a script that specifies the interpreter or program to be used to execute the script. It is denoted by the characters "#!" followed by the path to the interpreter.

The shebang line is important for a few reasons:

    Interpreter Specification: It tells the system which interpreter should be used to interpret and execute the script. Without the shebang line, the system would not know how to interpret the script and may try to execute it as a shell script by default. The shebang line allows the script to be executed with the appropriate interpreter.

    Portability: The shebang line ensures that the script can be executed consistently across different systems and environments. It allows the script to be executed on systems where the interpreter may be located in a different path or have a different name.

    Script Documentation: The shebang line serves as a form of documentation for the script, indicating the intended interpreter. It helps other developers and users understand the purpose and requirements of the script.

For example, a shebang line for a Bash script would be:

bash

#!/bin/bash

This tells the system to use the Bash interpreter to execute the script.

Overall, including a shebang line at the start of a script is considered good practice as it ensures the script is executed correctly and consistently, regardless of the system or environment in which it is run.

NOTE THAT THE SHEBANG LINE IS ONLY APPLICABLE TO SCRIPTS THAT ARE INTENDED TO BE EXECUTED DIRECTLY, NOT FOR SCRIPTS THAT ARE SOURCED WITHIN ANOTHER SCRIPT OR INTERPRETED IN A DIFFERENT MANNER.
