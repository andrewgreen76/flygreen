THOUGHTS ON HOW AND WHEN TO CREATE MY OWN COMPILER 
===================================================================================

[??]		= your C compiler	~(cmp , comp , compl , cmpl)


Q : What is my attitude towards writing my first C compiler ?
Q : Do I want to write my second C compiler ? 


===================================================================================
PHILOSOPHY BEHIND THE (FIRST) C COMPILER 
===================================================================================

 . VERY STANDARD , VERY VANILLA

 . ALL STUDENTS SHOULD LEARN THE SAME CODE-READING AND CODE-WRITING HABITS
    . CLARITY OVER BREVITY
  
 . STILL MY OWN ? : 
    . "the brand name" : having "icc" all over the place would probably be unnecessary
    . however , we don't want to use "cc" as that suggests the original Unix C compiler 
    . my preferred identifiers : will have to stick with frequently seen naming conventions 


 . don't want to write another compiler - I'll be educating myself to educate others
    => will be following D. McCarthy's lead
    . nearly all of his code nuances will demand my full and undivided attention
      as I'll be making some changes of my own 
 . educational - clarity over brevity
    . VERY STANDARD , VERY VANILLA
    . in certain "compliance" with most other languages , especially C and the `make` utility
    . ALL STUDENTS SHOULD LEARN THE SAME CODE-READING AND CODE-WRITING HABITS
      (sometimes individual imagination can get over-the-top and be in our way) 
    . developed to be small
    . should stay small 
 . but STILL MY OWN - IDEALLY WITH "THE BRAND NAME" and preferred identifiers (if possible)

My second C compiler : 
 . don't really want to write another one
