COMMON TYPES OF TRANSISTORS 
===================================================================================

 . BJT - "used in modern electronics for applications like amplification, switching, and high-current circuits
       	  due to their robustness and linear characteristics"
 . MOSFET - "higher switching speeds, lower power consumption due to voltage-driven rather than current-driven
   	     operation, smaller size, and better efficiency in digital and high-frequency circuits"
