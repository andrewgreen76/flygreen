The Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) was first specified in RFC 977, which was published in February 1986. This protocol was designed for the distribution, retrieval, and posting of news articles in a decentralized and distributed network environment, primarily for Usenet newsgroups. While NNTP has been widely used in the past, its popularity has decreased over the years with the rise of web-based forums and other communication platforms.
