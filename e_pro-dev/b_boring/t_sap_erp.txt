SAP (Systems, Applications, and Products) is an enterprise resource planning (ERP) software that provides integrated business solutions to various industries. The SAP system architecture is designed to support the functionalities of the SAP software suite and is based on a three-tier client-server architecture.

1. Presentation Layer: The presentation layer is the front-end interface that interacts with users. It includes SAP GUI (Graphical User Interface) or web-based interfaces, allowing users to access and interact with the SAP system.

2. Application Layer: The application layer is where the business logic and processing take place. It consists of one or more application servers that handle specific tasks, such as financials, sales, inventory management, human resources, and more. Each application server runs the SAP application software and processes user requests and transactions.

3. Database Layer: The database layer stores all the business data used by the SAP system. It typically comprises a high-performance database management system (DBMS) capable of handling large volumes of data. Common database systems used with SAP include SAP HANA, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and IBM DB2.

Key characteristics of the SAP system architecture include:

- Scalability: The architecture can be scaled up or down to accommodate varying numbers of users and data volumes.

- Redundancy: The system is designed with redundancy to ensure high availability and data integrity.

- Load Balancing: Load balancing is used to distribute user requests evenly across multiple application servers to optimize performance.

- Centralized Administration: The SAP system allows centralized administration and management of various components, making it easier to maintain and monitor.

- Integration: The architecture supports seamless integration between different SAP modules and external systems, enabling data exchange and process automation across the organization.

SAP system architecture provides a robust and flexible platform for organizations to manage their business processes efficiently, support decision-making, and streamline operations across departments and functions.
