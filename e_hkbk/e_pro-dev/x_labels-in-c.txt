Yes, C supports labels, which are used in conjunction with the `goto` statement to control the flow of execution in a program. A label is a named identifier followed by a colon (`:`) and can be used as a target for `goto` statements. Hereâ€™s a brief example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int i = 0;

    start: // Label
    printf("i = %d\n", i);
    i++;

    if (i < 5) {
        goto start; // Jumps to the label "start"
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example:
- The label `start` is defined before the `printf` statement.
- The `goto start;` statement causes the program to jump back to the `start` label, creating a loop-like structure.

While labels and `goto` can be useful in certain situations, they are generally discouraged in favor of structured control flow constructs like loops and conditionals for better readability and maintainability.
