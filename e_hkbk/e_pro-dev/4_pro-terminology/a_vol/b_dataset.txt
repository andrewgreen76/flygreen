In computing, a dataset refers to a collection of data that is organized and treated as a single unit. It can consist of various types of data, such as text, numbers, images, or other forms of information, and may be structured in different ways depending on the requirements of the application or analysis.

Datasets can vary greatly in size and complexity, ranging from small datasets that fit in memory to large datasets that require distributed storage systems. They are commonly used in data analysis, machine learning, database management, and other computing applications to represent and manipulate structured or unstructured information for processing or analysis.
