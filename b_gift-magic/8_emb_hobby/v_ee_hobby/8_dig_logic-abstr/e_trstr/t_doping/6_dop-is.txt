A doping technique is a controlled process that intentionally introduces precise amounts of impurity atoms
  (such as boron, phosphorus, or arsenic) into specific regions of a silicon crystal lattice to permanently
  alter its electrical conductivity, turning it from intrinsically semi-insulating into either p-type
  (positive/hole-conducting) or n-type (negative/electron-conducting) semiconductor material—the essential
  building block for creating transistors, diodes, and all active devices in integrated circuits.
