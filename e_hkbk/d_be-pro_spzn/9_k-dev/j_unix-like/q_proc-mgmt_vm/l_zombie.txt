Can a child process finish before the parent process gets to wait()? What happens then?


"
Yes, it is possible for a child process to finish before the parent process reaches the `wait()` or `waitpid()` call. When a child process terminates, it becomes a "zombie" process until its exit status is retrieved by the parent. If the parent has not yet called `wait()` or `waitpid()` to collect the exit status, the child process remains in the zombie state.

The operating system retains information about the terminated child process, including its exit status, until the parent retrieves that information. If the parent never calls `wait()` or `waitpid()`, zombie processes may accumulate.

To handle this situation properly and avoid zombie processes, it's good practice for the parent process to promptly call `wait()` or `waitpid()` after forking a child. If a child has already terminated, the `wait()` or `waitpid()` call will retrieve its exit status immediately. If the child is still running, the parent will be suspended until the child terminates.

Here's an example illustrating the concept:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    pid_t pid = fork();

    if (pid == -1) {
        perror("fork");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    } else if (pid == 0) {
        // Code for the child process
        printf("Child process is running\n");
        sleep(2);
        printf("Child process is done\n");
        exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
    } else {
        // Code for the parent process
        printf("Parent process is waiting for the child\n");

        // Parent waits for the child's exit status
        int status;
        pid_t child_pid = waitpid(pid, &status, 0);

        if (child_pid == -1) {
            perror("waitpid");
            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
        }

        if (WIFEXITED(status)) {
            printf("Child process with PID %d exited with status %d\n", child_pid, WEXITSTATUS(status));
        }

        printf("Parent process is done\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the parent waits for the child using `waitpid()`. If the child has already terminated, the parent immediately collects its exit status; otherwise, the parent is suspended until the child terminates. Properly handling the exit status prevents zombie processes from accumulating in the system.
