What's the command for listing all branches?
ChatGPT

To list all branches in your Git repository, you can use the following command in Bash:

bash

git branch

This command will display a list of all branches in your repository. The currently checked out branch will be indicated with an asterisk (*) next to its name.

If you want to see both local branches and remote-tracking branches, you can use the -a or --all flag:

bash

git branch -a

This will show all branches, including both local and remote branches. Remote branches are prefixed with the name of the remote repository they belong to.
