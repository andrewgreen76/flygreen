OPTIMIZING CLIENT-SERVER COMMUNICATION IN AN NFS : 
==================================================================================================


Massive I/O traffic on the link 
 => slow DFS


CACHING :
  |
  . Instead of having the server playing close to the vest
  | and the client sending tons of requests over the link ,
  | a copy of the file can be moved over the link once
  | and [CACHED] on the client's side.
  |
  - ... but only individual blocks are cached 
     . every new unaccessed block would have to be retrieved from the server


BUFFERING :
 . If we want to change the file and keep the updates ,
   we can write directly to the copy (located in the write buffer)
   and send it back to overwrite the original on the server's disk.
