Yes, there are systems that rely purely on software rendering to display a desktop environment. Software rendering refers to the process of utilizing the CPU and software algorithms to render graphics and display them on the screen, without relying on dedicated graphics hardware.

One example of such a system is a virtual machine (VM) or emulator that emulates a computer system or a specific hardware platform. In this case, the graphics rendering is performed entirely in software by the virtual machine or emulator, as it does not have direct access to the underlying hardware graphics capabilities.

Another example is low-end or older hardware that lacks dedicated graphics hardware or has limited graphics capabilities. In these cases, the desktop environment or operating system relies on software rendering to display graphics on the screen. The CPU performs the necessary calculations and rendering tasks to generate the visual output.

Software rendering can be resource-intensive and may not provide the same level of performance and graphical fidelity as dedicated hardware-accelerated rendering. However, it can still be functional for basic desktop environments and applications, particularly on systems with limited hardware resources.

It's worth noting that modern desktop environments and operating systems typically leverage hardware-accelerated rendering through dedicated graphics processing units (GPUs) or integrated graphics solutions, as it offers superior performance and graphical capabilities. However, there are scenarios and systems where software rendering is utilized due to hardware limitations or specific requirements.
