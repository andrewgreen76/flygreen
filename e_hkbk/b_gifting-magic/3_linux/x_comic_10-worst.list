Top 10 Worst Linux Distros
The Top Ten
1
Apartheid Linux

Blatantly racist... what more is there to say?

The distro of choice for Fascists, who wouldn't enjoy being associated with that crowd. /s.

I prefer dark mode.
2
Ubuntu Satanic Edition

I think it's stupid that it's an actual distribution, but I'm somewhat not surprised since Linux is open source, meaning anyone can come and make their own distro, but honestly this distribution is just taking "open source" WAY WAY too far. I'm highly against satanism by the way.

That fact that it exists in the first place is just bad enough.
3
Hannah Montana Linux

I can't believe this actually exists, this is licensed?

You must be kidding me.

Red Star OS

Home to that many privacy violations it isn't Linux. Sorry, Kim.

Red Star OS blatantly plagiarizes macOS and defies the principles of Linux.

A closed-sourced Linux distribution.

Really bad, can't access internet.
5
Linux for N******

Also blatantly racist, makes me wonder why people even make this garbage.
6
Justin Bieber Linux (Biebian)
7
LinuXXX
8
Linspire

Too unstable for comfort.
9
Ubuntu

From the Amazon analytics, the Unity desktop, and heavy encouragement to use snaps, Ubuntu has a history of Canonical trying to force what they think is best on its users.

A lot of useless propaganda. "Ubuntu is awesome!" "Ubuntu is awesome!" Grow up, you Ubuntu people.

For those who can't configure Debian...

Arch Linux

How to identify an Arch User? They'll tell before you ask.
Never seen an Arch User who do any serious productive work.
Unstable. Updates will make you stressed.

Arch is far too difficult to install for newcomers, and its fanboys are toxic.

I disagree, Arch is made for power users and the brave people who dares to work with the terminal

Because it's users suck
The Contenders

Ubuntu Christian Edition

They want Jesus and God to use it to keep track on what all the humans are doing so that they can know who goes to Heaven.
12
Debian
13
Robolinux

I wont say its bad but its kinda dead...
14
MX Linux

Fails at being a windows clone. I have no idea how you could ruin the kde desktop environment, but the people who made this distro actually figured it out.

Kali Linux

The distro of choice for little script kiddies who want to show the whole world that they're Ub3R 133t h4xX0rZz!11! If you actually use Kali Linux for its intended purpose, chances are you probably don't brag that you run it.

Too popular with script kiddies. Besides, who wouldn't want a distro that is root-only, only supports its own software and is used by hackers.

Hey, you think you're a hacker, here's Kali linux. I'm seriously sick of that damn OS
16
Zorin OS
17
Puppy Linux

The hard drive installs are always slowly breaking itself...

Running as root sucks.
18
Manjaro

Pretends to be suitable for beginners only to require advanced knowledge to fix if it breaks down, which it will. They pretend that packages are more stable just because they wait on them for a week for Arch users to report bugs first. Manjaro encourages users to misuse pacman commands and perform partial upgrades that cause more headaches in the long run.

Does the best job of being stable for a while and then suddenly breaking.
19
Gentoo

Gentoo takes FOREVER to install packages since it compiles everything from source. Setting "USE" flags is a massive pain and it can take an entire weekend to get a desktop environment done.
