In Bash, when you pass a string with spaces in it as an argument to a function or script, the shell will automatically split the string into multiple positional parameters based on spaces unless you explicitly quote the string. This behavior is part of how Bash's word splitting works.

Here's an example to illustrate this behavior:

```bash
my_function() {
    echo "The first argument is: $1"
    echo "The second argument is: $2"
}

# Call the function with one argument containing spaces
my_function "arg1 with spaces" arg2
```

In this example, the first argument to `my_function` is `"arg1 with spaces"` enclosed in double quotes. This preserves the spaces within the argument, and when you run the function, it will correctly treat `"arg1 with spaces"` as a single argument:

```
The first argument is: arg1 with spaces
The second argument is: arg2
```

However, if you don't enclose the argument with double quotes and call the function like this:

```bash
my_function arg1 with spaces arg2
```

Bash will split the argument at spaces and treat them as separate positional parameters:

```
The first argument is: arg1
The second argument is: with
```

To preserve spaces within a single argument, make sure to enclose the argument in double quotes or single quotes when calling the function. This prevents Bash from breaking the argument into multiple positional parameters.
