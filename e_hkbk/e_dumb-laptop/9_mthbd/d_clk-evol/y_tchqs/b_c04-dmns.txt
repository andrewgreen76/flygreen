Multiple clock domains refer to the practice of dividing a digital system, such as a CPU or an SoC (System-on-Chip), into distinct regions, each operating on its own clock signal or frequency. These clock domains are often synchronized with each other but can have independent clock rates, phases, or sources.

The use of multiple clock domains allows different parts of the system to operate at their own optimal frequencies, which can improve overall performance, power efficiency, and timing closure. It also facilitates the integration of heterogeneous components with varying speed requirements or power constraints within the same system.

In modern processors and SoCs, multiple clock domains are commonly employed to manage complex designs with diverse functional blocks, such as CPU cores, memory controllers, I/O interfaces, and specialized accelerators. Each of these blocks may have its own clock domain tailored to its specific requirements, while synchronization mechanisms ensure proper communication and data transfer between domains.
