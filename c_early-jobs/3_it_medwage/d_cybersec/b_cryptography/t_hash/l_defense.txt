BENEFITS OF HASHING
===================================================================================

 . Passwords are not to be stored in plaintext anywhere, including a database server where it can be stolen.
 . If an attacker finds out they can steal your cookies, they can steal the cookies of others and realize
     that the whole database is fair game.
 . Instead, store a hash digest of the password, which would be pretty much impossible to recover the password
     from.
 . Though a hacker may have access to the hash digests, the database's hashing function requires an actual
     password as the input, so having the hash digests of those passwords would be rather useless.


Hashing complexity:
 . The tougher the hashing function, the more resource intensive a brute force attack would have to be.
 . Time (a sufficient time fram) and resources (techological resources) are to be accounted for when raising
     concerns over brute force attacks.


Chain hashing:
 . can make hacking efforts much, much more frustrating


Malicious efforts with "rainbow tables":
 . used in expediting recovery of passwords from the digests
 . contains ALL the possible password combos along with their corresponding hashes
 . a trade-off between computational power and DISK SPACE
   => with huge amounts of disk space on the hacker's side time may now not be on the target's side
