Formal language :
 . FORMAL LANGUAGE = STRINGS GENERATED FROM A FORMULA 
 . a certain type of language (subset)
 . the automaton follows a certain rule / pattern / behavior / formula 


Grammar :
 . generates strings
    . randomly or follows a formula ? 
 . a^n >= 1
    . ???
 . regular grammar : ??? 
||
(Formal) language :
 . a set of strings
 . ALL STRINGS ARE FINITE 
 . a -> n>=1
 . grammar for a machine 
    . accepts strings 
 . question that needs to be answered
 . regular language :
    . DFA/NFA (deterministic finite acceptor) 
 . FSM (finite state machine)
 . infinite language :
    . has an infinite number of strings 
||
Automaton :
 . a machine that accepts strings 
 . model of a device
 . adding memory
 . are all machines Turing machines ?
