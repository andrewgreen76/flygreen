  I. it has to be fast 
     
 II. there has to be an integrity check
     . use the hash code of the file being transmitted to reflect the integrity 
     . one tiny change to the file should affect the hash code 
	. Method 1 : avalanche effect is preferred 
	   . a change in the file should mean a change in the hash code , and
	     a change in the hash code should snowball as changes throughout
	     the hash code 
	   . various algorithms for achieving that
	. Method 2 : digit-check
	   . a single change would affect a digit in the hash code 
	   
III. avoid collisions 
     . we want new info to populate an unused bucket
        . we don't want to waste space 
        . we don't want to spend time traversing a list 
     => we want to avoid generating the same hash code/slot num for 2+ keys 
     |
     Achieving uniqueness :
       . very important when expecting a huge number of inclusions 
       + increase the size of the array (to miss a populated bucket) 
       => increase the modulo divisor
       => the hash table should expect a large hash dividend , so increase the range of possible hashing outputs
       + having a very complex hashing algorithm can certainly help
       => the hashing algorithm will have to be a slower
