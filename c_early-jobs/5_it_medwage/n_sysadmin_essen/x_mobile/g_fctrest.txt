FACTORY RESET AND MOBILE OS UPDATING
===================================================================================

Factory reset - removes:
 . user data
 . user-installed apps
 . customizations
 => Back up or sync to the cloud all the data the user wants to keep.


Factory reset with expansion storage in the mix.
  1. Some factory reset options cover **expansion storage** - attachments, like an SD card or a thumb drive, that
     may contain personal or proprietary data, so unmount and remove them first.
  2. Other factory reset options ignore expansion storage when you need it wiped, so it will need to be wiped using
     the right factory reset option.


When to factory-reset a mobile device:
 . when the device changes hands
 . when it is due for a repair
 . when troubleshooting a device (but only as the option of last resort)


OTA:
 . over-the-air, a method of providing updates for the OS on a mobile device
