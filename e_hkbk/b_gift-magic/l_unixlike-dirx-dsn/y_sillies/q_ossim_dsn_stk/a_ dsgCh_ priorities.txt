Every item on the list below will have a dedicated creative module -- 
 -- design section and development tools. Listed in order from most 
to least important: 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


Design priorities: 
 - ways of achieving a deeply satisfying user experience: 
   music, sounds, story, user-friendliness, effective teaching, in-game 
   achievements, appreciation of the user's efforts. 

Music 

Sounds 
 + for actions
 + for events
 + ambient sounds 

Storytelling: 
 + The user assumes the avatar of the story's main character; CAOSim addresses 
   to the user as such. 
 + tell a philosophical, dramatic, semi-autobiographical story 
 + has voiceover work 
 + features illustrations (decide on aesthetic) 
 + ? other story-writing techniques ? 

Look and feel (for menus, gameplay, etc.): 
 + resolution aesthetic 
 + color schemes 
 + misc. 
 + customized by the user/student; the CAOSim is self-hosting. 

I/O: 
 + start off with a CL terminal or a GUI desktop 
 + keyboard-only functionality first
 + mouse functionality - later 

Simulation state/stage design and management: 
 + starting interface: 
   = elements - pixels, data and vis.rep (pixels) as objects 
   = GUI panels 
   = GUI menus 
 + workload in projects 
 + two major types of projects: 
   = customizing DOSBox output -or- creating your own text-based interface 
   = creating your own GUI/desktop 
 + every project has its own iteration of a sys sim 
 + OSSim hosting features - served through a user-friendly interface 
 + that sys sim will be made of its own objects (programs, libraries, 
   etc.) 
 + robust object/program construction is promoted 
 + mechanic for preservation of project content
   = the ability to save and load project files 


Setup for the DOSBox module: mode 12h/13h in C/asm (640x480x16 / 320x200x256)

Extra credit: 
 - animation ticking 
 - other animation tricks 
 - scrolling 
 - ? BBS ? licensed software ? 
   = own Internet, custom comm protocol, custom security protocol, 
	SSH/SSL/HTTP/STMP/etc. 
 - ? modules as sims ? 
 - ? GDOS ? (custom kernel, pre-processor, compiler, assembler (Z80 
   or else), linker, loader, etc.) 
For Linux: 
 - 
For Mac OS X: 
 - 
For Raspberry PI: 
 - 
Portability 
 + for Windows, Linux, MS-DOS, Mac OS X 
 + re-writing from scratch vs. macro-based OS check 
Debugging techniques and integrity checks
