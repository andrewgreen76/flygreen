What is American McGee's latest project?
ChatGPT
As of my knowledge cutoff of September 2021, American McGee's latest project was "Alice: Asylum," which is a prequel to his previous games "American McGee's Alice" and "Alice: Madness Returns." The game is being developed by Spicy Horse, which is American McGee's game development studio based in Shanghai, China. However, there has been no official update on the project since 2019, so it's unclear if the game is still in development or if there have been any recent updates.

ChatGPT
As of my knowledge cutoff of September 2021, American McGee's latest output was a mobile game called "OZ: Broken Kingdom," which was released in 2016. American McGee was the creative director of the game, which was developed by his studio, Spicy Horse, and published by Nexon.

However, it's worth noting that American McGee is a prolific game developer and designer, and he may have released new projects since then that I'm not aware of, especially as I don't have access to real-time updates.
