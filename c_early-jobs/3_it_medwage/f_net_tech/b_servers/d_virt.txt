SERVER VIRTUALIZATION
===================================================================================

A server can be:
  |
 (a) a device providing one specific service
  | + more resources for the same service => more performant service
  | - expensive
  | - you can run only one service
  | . See whether one service is worth the cost of the server.
  | - needs maintenance - you have to take if offline and fix it quickly before firing it back up
  | - needs updates
  |
 (b) a virtualized instance (process) providing a specific service
    + you can run multiple services on one machine (with each service in its own instance), saving money
    + Services can be migrated onto a different server when this one needs maintenance.
    . Only one service can be provided within one instance.
    - mild performance from every service
    

Server virtualization - basics:
 . a server will typically have multiple instances
 . every virtual instance provides one server
