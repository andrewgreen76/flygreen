To address memory leaks in C code, developers can:

    Identify and locate the source of the memory leak by using memory profiling tools or debuggers to track memory allocation and deallocation.
    Ensure that allocated memory is properly deallocated when it is no longer needed, using corresponding deallocation functions (e.g., free() in C).
    Use proper error handling and cleanup mechanisms to handle exceptional cases and ensure that memory is released even in error scenarios.
