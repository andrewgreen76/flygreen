To back up Windows 10 on a USB stick, you can use the built-in "File History" feature or create a system image using the "Backup and Restore (Windows 7)" tool. Here are the steps for both methods:

Using File History:
1. Connect the USB stick to your computer.
2. Go to "Settings" by clicking on the Start menu and selecting the gear icon.
3. In the Settings window, click on "Update & Security."
4. From the left sidebar, select "Backup" and click on "Add a drive" under "Back up using File History."
5. Choose the USB stick from the list of available drives. If it doesn't appear, make sure it is properly connected.
6. Once selected, File History will automatically start backing up your files to the USB stick.

Creating a System Image:
1. Connect the USB stick to your computer.
2. Type "Control Panel" in the Windows search bar and open it.
3. In Control Panel, go to "Backup and Restore (Windows 7)."
4. On the left sidebar, click on "Create a system image."
5. Select the USB stick as the backup location and follow the prompts to create the system image.
   Note: Creating a system image will back up your entire system, including the operating system, programs, and files.

Remember to regularly update your backups to ensure your data is protected.



The back-up process is supposed to take up to 40 mins. Took me over three hours.
