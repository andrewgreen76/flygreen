To store the output of a command's standard output (stdout) in a variable in a Bash script, you can use command substitution. There are two common ways to do this:

1. Using Backticks (``):

   ```bash
   variable_name=`command`
   ```

2. Using the `$()` syntax:

   ```bash
   variable_name=$(command)
   ```

Here's an example of how to store the output of a command in a variable using both methods:

```bash
# Using backticks
output1=`echo "Hello, World!"`

# Using $() syntax
output2=$(echo "Hello, World!")

# Display the contents of the variables
echo "Output using backticks: $output1"
echo "Output using \$() syntax: $output2"
```

In this example, the `echo` command is used to generate the "Hello, World!" message, and the output of the `echo` command is stored in the `output1` and `output2` variables using both backticks and the `$()` syntax.

Both methods work, but the `$()` syntax is more modern and recommended because it can be nested more easily and is generally easier to read.
