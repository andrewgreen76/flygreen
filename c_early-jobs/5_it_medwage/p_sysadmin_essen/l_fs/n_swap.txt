SWAP SPACE
===================================================================================

Virtual memory :
 . the concept of taking up a part of some other physical resource and reappropriating it as a kind of an
     extension of RAM (which we also refer to as virtual memory), thereby creating the illusion that the
     machine has more memory than originally specified by the vendor.


Swap space:
 . a disk partition reserved for storing data that cannot fit into RAM, thus embodying virtual memory.
 . It is comprised of PAGES (of a certain equal size).
 . Paging : the act of moving page-size data from RAM to swap space or vice versa.
 . Page-size data that goes unused in the process space of an application for a period of time will get
     "evicted" onto the swap space. (LRU - least recently used data.)
 . Addressing relevant pages on the swap space is abstracted away to the application process and is carefully
     managed by the kernel. There is a method of mapping the actual physical addresses to the so-called
     "virtual" addresses that the application process understands.
 . Because the SSD and the HDD in a machine are typically the ones to support virtual memory, we almost
     never use any space on a thumb drive as swap space.
