NAT (NETWORK ADDRSES TRANSLATION) : 
===================================================================================

 . a system / technique 
 . implemented in various ways 


Goal #1: coping with the limitations of IPv4 coverage.
 . allows a network to have one public IP address and multiple private IP addresses
 . This allows for coverage of 4.3 billion **PUBLIC** IP addresses ; delivery to/from private IP addresses
    is handled separately.
 => this helps with the IPv4's limitation on global coverage
 |
 . NAT is configured on routers 


Goal #2: protection. 
 |
 . NAT performs IP MASQUERADING by translating one IP address into another. 
 . ONE-TO-MANY NAT : 100's-1000's of LAN clients "share" the same public IP address - that of their gateway.
 |
 . The gateway - a router or a firewall - will : 
   . log the source IP address (let's call it SIPA) of an outgoing IP datagram
   -> map it to its own IP address (let's call it RIPA) on the router's send-to-receive networking interface,
	thus obscuring the client's real address and putting itself in between as a safeguard
   -> receive an incoming packet, recognize the RIPA as the destination IP address, and treat it as the
	response packet 
   -> inspect the packet for anything malicious
   -> Best-case scenario: the gateway will find nothing malicious, write SIPA into the destination IP address,
	and let the packet move forward to the intended private recipient.
 => NAT allows LAN play close to the vest when it comes to handing private IP addresses.
