LOG-STRUCTURED FILE SYSTEM (LFS) : 
=================================================================================

Purpose :
 . improving performance of writing to FS


Method / features :
 |
 + batching file changes in a memory SEGMENT before logging
    + reduces amount of metadata and I/O operations 
    . a.k.a. write-buffering 
    . a.k.a. segmenting 
 - writing into free space instead of overwriting 
    + target is safe
 - sequential writing to the disk
    . may be inefficient 
 + more efficient use of RAID


 . previously batched data blocks are followed by a metadata block
