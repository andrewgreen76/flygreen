Load-store architecture is a computer architecture design that separates the instructions for loading data from memory (load operations) and storing data to memory (store operations) from the instructions that perform arithmetic or logic operations. In a load-store architecture, operations like addition, subtraction, and logical operations can only be performed on data that is first loaded from memory into registers, and the results must be stored back to memory when finished.

Key characteristics of load-store architecture include:

1. **Register-Register Operations:** Arithmetic and logic operations typically involve registers as operands. Data must be loaded from memory into registers before these operations can be performed, and results are stored back into registers.

2. **Separate Load and Store Instructions:** Load-store architectures have separate instructions for loading data from memory (load instructions) and storing data to memory (store instructions).

3. **Memory Access Instructions:** Load instructions specify a memory location to read data from and load it into a register. Store instructions specify a memory location where data from a register should be written.

4. **Efficient Register Usage:** Load-store architectures often rely heavily on registers for temporary data storage. Registers are usually fast and directly accessible by the CPU, making operations on register data efficient.

5. **Improved Parallelism:** This architecture can enable better parallelism because the CPU can perform multiple load and store operations in parallel with arithmetic and logic operations. This can lead to more efficient use of execution units and improved performance.

Load-store architectures are commonly found in modern computer architectures, including most RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) architectures. The separation of load and store operations from arithmetic and logic operations helps simplify instruction decoding and pipeline processing, which can lead to faster and more efficient execution of instructions. Examples of processors that use load-store architectures include ARM, MIPS, and PowerPC.

In contrast, some older computer architectures, known as complex instruction set computers (CISC), allowed memory operations to be part of the same instructions that performed arithmetic and logic operations. However, modern CPUs, including those based on CISC instruction sets like x86, often internally use a load-store architecture to improve performance and simplify the processor's design.
