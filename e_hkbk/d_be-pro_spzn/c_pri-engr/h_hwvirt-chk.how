[CPU support] 


Check the CPU: Open a terminal on your Linux system and run the following command to check if your CPU supports hardware virtualization:

bash

egrep -c '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo

If the command returns a value greater than 0, it means hardware virtualization is supported (vmx for Intel CPUs and svm for AMD CPUs).
