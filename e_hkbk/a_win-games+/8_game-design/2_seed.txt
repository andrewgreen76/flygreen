A seed is an initial value used to initialize a pseudo-random number generator, ensuring that the sequence of random numbers generated can be reproduced by using the same seed value.

"
A pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) uses mathematical algorithms and the seed value to produce a deterministic sequence of numbers that simulates randomness, allowing for repeatable results when the same seed is used.
