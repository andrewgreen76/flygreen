Safety :
- ONLY PLUG IN THE SOLDERING IRON the moment you are ready two solder a pad with a lead.
- ALWAYS LEAVE IT IN THE SPRING HOLDER when not using it. 



Proper soldering practices :
- "Make sure the surfaces to be soldered are clean."
- "Turn on the soldering iron and set temperature above the melting point of your solder.
  600°- 650°F (316°- 343°C) is a good place to start for lead-based solder and 650°- 700°F
  (343°- 371°C) for lead-free solder."
- Use flux regularly. It helps remove the films of oxide that form on the metal surfaces
  that are being soldered. That way the solder will retain good wetting (ability to melt).

Poor soldering instances to avoid : 
- dewetting :
  - solder drying up too quickly after balling up. 
- solder skip :
  - no actual solder connection between the PCB pad and the lead.
- solder bridge :
  - two or more pads become connected with excess solder.
