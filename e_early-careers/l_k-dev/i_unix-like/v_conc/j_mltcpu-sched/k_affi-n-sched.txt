The statement "With MQMS, jobs are more likely to remain on the same CPU across executions than with SQMS" is generally not accurate. In the context of multiprocessor scheduling, MQMS (Multi-Queue Multiprocessor Scheduling) and SQMS (Single-Queue Multiprocessor Scheduling) refer to different approaches for managing task scheduling in a multiprocessor system.

In both MQMS and SQMS, jobs or tasks can be scheduled on multiple CPUs, and the likelihood of a job remaining on the same CPU across executions depends on the scheduling policies and mechanisms employed, not solely on whether it's MQMS or SQMS. Let's clarify the concepts:

1. **MQMS (Multi-Queue Multiprocessor Scheduling):**
   - In MQMS, each CPU core has its own private queue of tasks. Each core independently schedules tasks from its own queue, leading to a more decentralized or per-core scheduling strategy. Jobs may be scheduled on different cores based on the availability of tasks in each core's queue.

2. **SQMS (Single-Queue Multiprocessor Scheduling):**
   - In SQMS, all CPU cores share a single global queue of tasks. The CPU scheduler makes decisions about which task to execute next based on the global queue. Tasks can be assigned to different cores depending on the scheduling decisions made by the central scheduler.

In both MQMS and SQMS, jobs can migrate between different CPUs based on load balancing decisions, system policies, or dynamic workload changes. The likelihood of a job remaining on the same CPU depends on factors such as the workload distribution, the scheduling policies in place, and whether load balancing mechanisms are actively moving tasks between cores.

If the goal is to keep jobs on the same CPU across executions, the scheduling policy and affinity mechanisms need to be explicitly designed to prioritize thread or process affinity to specific cores. Both MQMS and SQMS can be configured to support or inhibit such behavior based on the specific requirements and policies implemented by the scheduler.

In summary, the likelihood of a job remaining on the same CPU in MQMS or SQMS depends on the scheduling policies and mechanisms employed, and the statement should be evaluated in the context of the specific design choices made within each scheduling approach.

The relationship between cache affinity and the scheduling strategy (MQMS or SQMS) is not straightforward, and whether MQMS provides enhanced cache affinity compared to SQMS depends on various factors, including the specific design choices, workload characteristics, and the policies implemented by the scheduler.

**Cache Affinity in MQMS:**
- In MQMS, where each CPU core has its own private queue, there may be an opportunity to exploit cache affinity. Cache affinity refers to the tendency of keeping a thread or process on the same core to benefit from the cache locality of that specific core.

- If tasks consistently execute on the same core in MQMS, they can benefit from the continuity of the execution context and the likelihood of having relevant data in the core's cache. This could potentially enhance cache affinity.

**Cache Affinity in SQMS:**
- In SQMS, where all CPU cores share a single global queue, the scheduler has the flexibility to schedule tasks on any available core. While SQMS does not inherently prevent cache affinity, it may require additional mechanisms to explicitly manage and enforce affinity if that is a desired goal.

- Some SQMS schedulers may implement thread or process affinity mechanisms to enhance cache locality by keeping tasks on the same core.

**Considerations:**
- The effectiveness of cache affinity is influenced by factors such as the cache architecture, workload characteristics, and the specific policies implemented by the scheduler.

- Workloads with a high degree of spatial and temporal locality (where data and instructions are frequently accessed together and reused) are more likely to benefit from cache affinity.

- It's important to note that cache affinity is just one aspect of scheduling considerations, and other factors, such as load balancing, fairness, and overall system performance, also play crucial roles in determining the effectiveness of a scheduling strategy.

In summary, while MQMS may offer opportunities to exploit cache affinity, the impact on cache performance depends on various factors. Both MQMS and SQMS can be designed with mechanisms to enhance cache affinity, and the specific implementation details and workload characteristics will influence their effectiveness.
