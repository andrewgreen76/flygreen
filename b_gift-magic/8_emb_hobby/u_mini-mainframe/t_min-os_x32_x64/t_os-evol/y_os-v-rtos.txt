General-purpose OS:
 |
 . greater interactivity (with the user)
 . software diversity ("flexibility"): running different types of applications
 . hardware diversity: through drivers
 . "It's OK to not deliver on time." ("Non-deterministic timing.")
   . "Non-deterministic timing means that the exact time at which an operation completes cannot be guaranteed in
      advance because it depends on system load, scheduling, and other runtime factors."
 

RTOS:
 |
 . for time-critical tasks
 => must operate predictably
 . "The device must and will deliver on time and we know it." ("Strict timing guarantees.")
 . used in precise mass synchronization/orchestration of moving objects as well as in standalone objects
 . reliable sensor handling
 . safe coordination between signals
 |
 . Examples:
   (1) an airbag system
   (2) CNC milling: "a CNC milling machine relies on an RTOS-based motor controller to move cutting tools with
       precise timing and positioning to avoid damaging the part or the machine."
   (3) traffic light systems

"
A general-purpose OS is designed for flexibility and user interaction with non-deterministic timing, while an RTOS is designed for predictability and deterministic response to time-critical tasks.
