memory hierarchy : abstraction of smaller memory chips into a larger memory module.

cache hierarchy : abstraction of ~8 smaller cache units into a larger cache unit.

- RAM is large, slow, and inexpensive 
- cache is small, fast, and expensive 
- e.g., L1 = 512KB, L2 = 4MB, L3 = 32MB. The higher the cache, the slower and larger it is.
