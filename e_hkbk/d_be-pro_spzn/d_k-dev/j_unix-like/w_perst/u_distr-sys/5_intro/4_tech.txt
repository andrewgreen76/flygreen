INTERNET : 
=============================================================================

 . transmitting binary info
 . a song is encoded using 3 MB - 4 MB 


Media - intangible within the tangible :
 |
 + wired : using electricity (modulation)
    . ex. : shooting Morse code
    . ex. : Ethernet (copper cable) 
    + cheap 
    + multiple bits at a time 
    - lossy
    => good for relatively short distances
 |
 + wired : using (invisible) light waves by primitive means (optical signal) 
    + super-fast transmission
    + signal integrity over long distances 
    + multiple bits at a time (depending on the angle)
    - malleable
    - really expensive
    - hard to work make and maintain
 |
 . the majority of Internet connections are still wired
 |
 + wireless - using radio frequencies (inaudible sound waves)
    . sender takes binary data in memory and translates it into sound (modulation)
    . receiver catches the sound and translates it back to binary data (demodulation) 
    . different bits have different frequencies
    + "entirely mobile" : physically risk-free
    - signal loses clarity over long distances 


Primitive methods :
 . e.g. , telegraph key
 - need human users at all times (=> not automated)
 - slow
 - error-prone
 

Transmission capacity : 
|
Bandwidth : 
 . max transmission capacity for a certain device
 . speed 
||
Bit rate :
 . number of bits transmitted over a unit of time 
 . speed (bps) 
|
Latency : 
 . amount of time for a bit to travel from point A to point B
 . time (secs)
