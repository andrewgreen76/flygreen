Round out your knowledge of communication protocols and how to interface with different types of sensors. Determine if you want to work on RF, analog, or digital circuits primarily.

The skills learned in one CAD will carry over to the others. You will want to be specific on your resume though even if it is only familiarity with a program. Something like "I have opened [Insert CAD Name Here] and viewed schematics" can be enough to list the program on your resume.

In my opinion, Mentor Graphics is a horrible program that needs to die that is for some reason still commonly used. Altium has a better interface and is easier to find support for.
