In C, the `argv` parameter of the `main` function is an array of strings (`char*`) that represents the command-line arguments passed to the program. Each element of `argv` corresponds to a command-line argument, with `argv[0]` typically being the program name itself.

The size of each element (`argv[i]`) in `argv` is not fixed. Each element is a pointer to a null-terminated string, and the length of each string can vary based on the actual command-line argument provided.

However, it's important to note that the memory allocated for `argv` and its elements is managed by the operating system. The exact mechanism and memory layout can differ between operating systems and how the program is executed.

In most systems, the command-line arguments are passed as a contiguous block of memory, with each argument being null-terminated. The pointers in `argv` point to the start of each argument string. The memory for the argument strings is typically managed by the operating system, and the size of each string can depend on the length of the provided argument.

It's essential to handle the command-line arguments carefully to avoid buffer overflow or memory access issues. You should always validate and handle the arguments properly in your program to ensure the safety and correctness of the code.
