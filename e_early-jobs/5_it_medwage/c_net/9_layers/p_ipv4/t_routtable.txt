===================================================================================
ROUTING TABLE : 
===================================================================================

 . a list of entries , structured as a vector in code 
 . every router regularly updates its own routing table 


Common constitution :
 |
 . destination network 
    - logged as the network ID and the subnet mask 
    - separately or in CIDR form 
 . next hop : IP address of the next router for the packet to hit 
 . total hops
 . interface : IP address of the “outgoing” networking interface of the next router
 |
 . the exact make-up routing table depends on the make and class of the router 


Additional notes : 
 . in every entry the dest IP address is mapped to the networking interface of the next device that will receive the packet 
 . every major OS has a routing table 
 . core routers can have millions of entries 


The shortest **available** path between a pair of two nodes can change regularly due to : 
 . router malfunction or shutdown 
 . breakage 
 . new routers getting included 
 . acknowledging traffic congestion
