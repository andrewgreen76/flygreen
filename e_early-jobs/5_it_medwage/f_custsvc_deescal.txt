CUSTOMER SERVICE - DE-ESCALATION 
===================================================================================

When the user makes demands ,
 . allow for 10 secs of silence , give the user and yourself a chance to calm down , take a breath , and
     think things through 
 . OFFER THE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE
 . offer a 2-3 min break during the time of which you go talk to someone above you or do a triage 


Talking on top of one another :
 . there could be A DELAY ON THE LINE - if it's a phone conversation 
 . in a 1-on-1 conversation : give pause for about 10 secs , give the user and yourself a chance to calm down ,
     take a breath , and think things through 


Dealing with difficult customer service situations :
| . Depends. Who's on the offensive ? Who's on the defensive ?
|
You are on the DEFENSIVE : 
| . the "reboot" action - a working method for coping with a difficult moment
| . take a deep breath , take a break
|
IDENTIFY AND IGNORE THE TRIGGERS THAT PUT YOU ON THE OFFENSIVE. 
  . identify the trigger before it kicks in
