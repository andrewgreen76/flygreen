Address class system : 

    old system , widely used (CIDR - Classless Inter-Domain Routing - is replacing it)
    ACS is only for the “global IP address space” (not MAC addresses) 
    Each class represents a different kind of network. 
    class A : 
    - IP address = network ID (1st octet) + host ID (2nd , 3rd , 4th octets) 
    - network ID starts with 0…
    class B : 
    - IP address = network ID (1st , 2nd octets) + host ID (3rd , 4th octets) 
    - network ID starts with 10…
    class C : 
    - IP address = network ID (1st , 2nd , 3rd octets) + host ID (4th octets) 
    - network ID starts with 110…
    class D : 
    - used in multicasting (datagram sent to all LAN nodes) 
    - network ID starts with 1110…
    class E : 
    - IP addresses are unassigned and are used for testing procedures 
    - a class will have a coverage of X IP addresses based on the number of BITS IN THE HOST ID
