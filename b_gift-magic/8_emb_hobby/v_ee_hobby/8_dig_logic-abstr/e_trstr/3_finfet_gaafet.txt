LS vs. HC vs. FinFET vs. GAAFET
===================================================================================

"
LS (Low-Power Schottky TTL) uses bipolar transistors for 5 V, moderate-speed (9 ns), higher-power discrete logic; HC (High-Speed CMOS) uses planar MOSFETs for 2–6 V, low-power, comparable speed; FinFET is a 3D CMOS transistor structure (7 nm–3 nm) for ultra-low leakage and high density in modern SoCs; GAAFET (Gate-All-Around FET) is the next-generation nanosheet transistor (2 nm+) improving on FinFET with even better power efficiency and performance scaling.
"


FinFET:
 . Fin Field-Effect Transistor
 . "FinFET is a 3D transistor architecture with a thin fin-like channel wrapped by the gate on three sides, enabling
    better electrostatic control, reduced leakage, and improved performance in advanced CMOS processes (typically 22
    nm and below)."


GAAFET:
 . Gate-All-Around Field-Effect Transistor
 . "GAAFET is a next-generation transistor architecture where the gate fully surrounds the channel on all four sides
    using stacked nanosheets, enabling superior electrostatic control, reduced leakage, and continued scaling beyond
    FinFET in sub-3 nm CMOS processes."
