To print the first two lines of a file to the terminal in Bash, you can use the `head` command with the `-n` option:

```bash
head -n 2 filename
```

Replace `filename` with the actual name or path of the file you want to display the first two lines from.

For example, if you have a file called `textfile.txt`, you can run:

```bash
head -n 2 textfile.txt
```

This will display the first two lines of the `textfile.txt` file in the terminal.
