READING FROM A FILE : 
=========================================================================================

 . get the pathname
 -> open() - traverses the pathname
    . start at '/' dir
    -> read '/' inode (i-num = 2)
    -> loop :
       -> read dir data blocks -> look up child in the pathname by its inode
    -> check perm in leaf_inode 
    
    If good to read : 
    -> find the file
    -> alloc fd in the OFT
    -> ret fd_addr to user
    
 -> read() 
    -> read the 1st block
    -> update the inode (time last accessed)
    -> update fd in the OFT for future reads
    
 -> close the file
    -> dealloc fd in the OFT
