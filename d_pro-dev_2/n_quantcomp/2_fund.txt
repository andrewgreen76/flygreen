Quantum computing is founded on the principles of quantum mechanics.

Quantum mechanics is concerned with:
 (1) all possible states a particle (its position is a state), a system, or (in the case of quantum mechanics) a qubit can have, and
 (2) the probability that particle/system will end up in that state given a certain input

A quantum state:
 (a) a possible state of a thing
 (b) unknown state

Wavefunction:
 . all possible states of a particle/system captured within one graph and that graph's corresponding mathematical expression
