The stack management conventions depend "on the specific calling convention used (e.g., cdecl, stdcall) and the compiler's implementation." 

"
If there are discrepancies with other sources, it's possible they are referring to different calling conventions or specific implementations. Itâ€™s always a good idea to check the calling conventions used by your specific compiler or development environment.
"


========================================================================================
C DECLARATION
========================================================================================

"
`cdecl` (C Declaration) is a calling convention in which the CALLER CLEANS UP THE STACK after the function call, and function parameters are pushed onto the stack from right to left.
"


========================================================================================
STDCALL 
========================================================================================

"
`stdcall` is a calling convention where the CALLEE CLEANS UP THE STACK after the function call, and function parameters are pushed onto the stack from right to left."
