What do functions with names ending in "_s()" have to do with security?
ChatGPT

In C and C++, functions with names ending in "_s()" are typically associated with secure variants of standard library functions. These secure functions are part of the Secure C Library Extensions (ISO/IEC TR 24731) and are intended to provide safer alternatives to their standard counterparts.

The "_s" in the function name stands for "secure" and indicates that the function incorporates additional safety checks or behaviors to mitigate common security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, and other related issues.

These secure functions often take additional parameters compared to their standard counterparts, allowing the caller to specify the size of the destination buffer or perform other security-related checks. This helps prevent buffer overflows and other related security vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malicious actors.

It's worth noting that the use of secure functions does not guarantee complete security on its own. It is still important to follow secure coding practices, validate input data, and consider other security aspects in your code. The secure functions provide an extra layer of protection, but they should be used in combination with other security measures to ensure robust security in software development.
