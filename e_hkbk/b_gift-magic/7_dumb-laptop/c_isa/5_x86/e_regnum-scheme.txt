In the x86 register numbering scheme, the possible binary 3-bit combinations for the registers are as follows:

- 000: EAX register
- 001: ECX register
- 010: EDX register
- 011: EBX register
- 100: ESP register
- 101: EBP register
- 110: ESI register
- 111: EDI register

If the source register is EBX, bits 2-0 of the ModR/M byte would typically be set to 011 in binary, as EBX is represented by register number 3 in the x86 register numbering scheme.
