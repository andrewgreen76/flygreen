The earliest Intel MPU (Microprocessor Unit) to feature multiple ALUs (Arithmetic Logic Units) was the Intel 8086 processor, which was introduced in 1978. The Intel 8086 was a 16-bit microprocessor and one of the first members of the x86 family of processors. While it only had one primary ALU, it also featured additional ALUs for handling specific tasks such as address calculation and data manipulation, effectively providing multiple execution units for improved performance and efficiency compared to earlier processors.
