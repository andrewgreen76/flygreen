To back up Windows 10 on a USB stick, you can use the built-in "File History" feature or create a system image using the "Backup and Restore (Windows 7)" tool. Here are the steps for both methods:

Using File History:
1. Connect the USB stick to your computer.
2. Go to "Settings" by clicking on the Start menu and selecting the gear icon.
3. In the Settings window, click on "Update & Security."
4. From the left sidebar, select "Backup" and click on "Add a drive" under "Back up using File History."
5. Choose the USB stick from the list of available drives. If it doesn't appear, make sure it is properly connected.
6. Once selected, File History will automatically start backing up your files to the USB stick.

Creating a System Image:
1. Connect the USB stick to your computer.
2. Type "Control Panel" in the Windows search bar and open it.
3. In Control Panel, go to "Backup and Restore (Windows 7)."
4. On the left sidebar, click on "Create a system image."
5. Select the USB stick as the backup location and follow the prompts to create the system image.
   Note: Creating a system image will back up your entire system, including the operating system, programs, and files.

Remember to regularly update your backups to ensure your data is protected.



The back-up process is supposed to take up to 40 mins, according to a blog that was posted in March of this year (2023). 
- EDIT : Took me over three hours.
- EDIT : Now it's taken four hours. Cherry on top : after reverting some of the back-up (i.e., deleting some of the backed-up files) and doing the math on the space on the USB stick, I figured that even 64GB of space on a stick would not be enough. We are looking at : 
  - C:\Windows : ~11GB
  - C:\Program Files : ~21GB
  - C:\Program Files : ~27GB
  - configs : ~500MB
  - $OF (whatever that is) : 3GB size / ~7GB size on disk
  - desktop and boot -related critical data : ~4GB size / ~8GB size on disk
  And this is all after I've removed much of the game-related files. I suspect some of this to be bloatware, but who am I to make that conclusion ?
- EDIT : I've been meaning to get a 128GB stick, but you know what ? It's Windows 10. I mean, it's older compared to Windows 11. I mean, how precious is it really to me ? (Just had a thought of "Just because something is old, doesn't mean you should throw it away". But some things that are old could prove themselves to be useless.)
