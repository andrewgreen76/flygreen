We can't understand the nature and purpose of the assembly language without discussing the following :
 |
 . abstraction (pre-written functionality already taking care of things for you behind the curtains at the lower level) 
     vs. implementation (personally written instructions or statements) 
 . legacy platforms - old tools and systems 
 . platform specifications (requirements) - the only things the system will work with 
 . compatibility modes , backwards compatibility
 |
 . MEMORY MANAGEMENT , process memory layout , memory monitoring 
 . CPU CONTROL handover between the kernel and the (subordinate) user processes
