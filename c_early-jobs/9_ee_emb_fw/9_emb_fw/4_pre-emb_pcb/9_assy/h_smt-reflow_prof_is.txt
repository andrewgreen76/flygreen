Temperature profile :

 . a.k.a. reflow profile 

 . The way the temperature needs to be changed across time to successfully complete any kind of reflow is reflected
   in a graph called the temperature profile.
   
 . "A temperature profile in hot air reflow is a controlled sequence of temperature changes—preheating, soaking,
    reflow, and cooling—designed to optimize soldering of electronic components onto a circuit board while minimizing
    thermal stress and defects."

 ! Look up the datasheet for the solder paste you want to use to see its reflow profile.
