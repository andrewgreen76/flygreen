The x86 system bus architecture doesn't have a one-to-one mapping of specific bits for control signals, addresses, data, and instructions like some simpler architectures might. Instead, the x86 architecture utilizes a set of signals and protocols to handle these tasks. However, we can discuss the typical functions associated with various bus lines:

1. **Control Signals**: Control signals manage the flow of data and instructions within the system. They include signals such as Read (RD), Write (WR), Memory/IO (M/IO), Interrupt Request (IRQ), Clock (CLK), Reset (RESET), and others. These signals control actions such as initiating memory or I/O operations, requesting interrupts, and resetting the system.

2. **Address Lines**: The address lines carry memory addresses generated by the CPU. The width of the address bus determines the maximum memory capacity that the system can address. In x86 systems, the number of address lines varies depending on the specific architecture and memory configuration. For example, a 32-bit address bus can address up to 4 GB of memory, while a 64-bit address bus can address much more.

3. **Data Lines**: The data lines are used to transfer data between the CPU and memory subsystem. They carry both instructions fetched from memory for execution by the CPU and data being read from or written to memory. The width of the data bus determines the maximum amount of data that can be transferred between the CPU and memory in a single operation. x86 systems commonly use data buses of varying widths, including 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, and 64-bit buses.

4. **Instruction Fetch**: In x86 systems, instructions are fetched from memory using the address lines and data lines. The specific bits used for instructions depend on the instruction encoding and the size of the instructions (which can vary). The CPU interprets the fetched instructions and executes them accordingly.

It's important to note that the x86 system bus is quite complex, and the specific signals and protocols used can vary depending on factors such as the CPU model, chipset, and system architecture. Additionally, modern x86 systems often use advanced features such as caches, pipelining, and out-of-order execution, which further complicate the interaction between the CPU and the rest of the system.
