The stack's INTERNAL pointer , A REFERENCE USED WITH OFFSETS TO :
 |
 . monitor values within the stack frame 
 . write / change values within the stack frame


 . We could totally do those things with the knowledge of where SP is at. 
     However , SP can change , mostly due to dynamic memory allocation and
     other unexpected pushes , but BP will never change for as long as
     it points to the base of the same stack frame that SP points to the top of.
