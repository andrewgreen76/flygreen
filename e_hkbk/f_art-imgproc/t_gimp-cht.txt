Dealing with alpha transparency in a PNG : 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

1) Observe the Windows > Dockable Dialogs > Layers section in the bottom-right corner of GIMP's interface.
   . where the "mode" / "normal" / "opacity" / "lock" / "background" crap is 
2) Add a new layer
   a) Layers > New Layer... -or-
   b) Right-click on the Layers section and go to "New Layer..."
3) In the "New Layer" window simply click OK. A new layer should be generated and seen in the Layers section. 
4) Make sure the layer is below the layer of the original image.
   . Drag it below the image if you have to.
   . As you can see, the stack top-to-bottom represents foreground-to-background.
   . The generated layer will be the backdrop to the transparent original image.
5) Click on the "Bucket Fill" tool, the bucket button in the section in the top left corner of GIMP's interface. 
   . Or use Shift+B
6) In that same corner, below the tool buttons are two prominent colored squares, one for the foreground and
   one for the background. Click the background square.
7) In the "Change Background Color" window choose the color for the background (of course, usually it's white).
   Then click OK.  
6) Below the foreground and background selection squares are a row of tiny tabs. Click on the "Tool Options" tab,
   the tiny tab with the television logo
7) Select the "BG color fill" radio button
8)
