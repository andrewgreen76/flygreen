DNS CACHE POISONING ATTACK
===================================================================================

In an untampered DNS:
 . a client sends a domain name (resolution request) to a DNS server
 . the DNS server talks to other, "deeper" servers for an IP address to resolve to
 . that server eventually gets the corresponding IP address and feeds it back to the client


Intrusion scenario:
 . "An intruder can insert a false DNS record by tricking a DNS resolver into accepting a forged response that
    <appears to come> from an authoritative server [really the hacker's system], often by guessing or predicting
    transaction IDs or exploiting vulnerabilities."
 . This way the legitimate target DNS server is suggested with a compromising DNS record(s) and the legitimate
    clients can have their DNS requests remapped to undesirable, malicious IP addresses.
