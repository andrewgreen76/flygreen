The Optimal Replacement Policy :
|
. when the swap "cache" in RAM is NOT full :
  . if the page is a hit
    . do nothing
  . if the page is a miss
    . add to the cache
. when the swap "cache" in RAM is FULL :
  . if the page is a hit
    . do nothing
  . if the page is a miss 
    . predict which page in the "cache" will be accessed "furthest in the future" , which is open to interpretation 
      . focus on the first or last inducted page ; that'll be the page "predicted to be accessed furthest in the future"
    . evict the targeted page and replace it with the missed page 

.
