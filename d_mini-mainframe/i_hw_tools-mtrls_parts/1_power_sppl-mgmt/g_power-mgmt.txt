The power distribution system in a laptop motherboard includes voltage regulator modules (VRMs), power management ICs, and various circuitry that distribute and regulate power from the battery and/or external power adapter to different components such as the CPU, GPU, and memory.

Historically, as CPUs became more powerful and required lower voltages for operation, the need for efficient voltage regulation closer to the CPU arose to mitigate power losses and ensure stable performance, leading to the development of Voltage Regulator Modules (VRMs).
