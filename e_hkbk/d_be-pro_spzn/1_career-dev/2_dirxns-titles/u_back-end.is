A back-end developer is a web developer who specializes in building and maintaining the server-side of web applications. Unlike front-end developers who focus on the user interface and user experience, back-end developers work on the server-side logic, databases, and application functionality that power the web application and handle data processing. Here are the key tasks and responsibilities of a back-end developer:

1. Server-Side Development: Back-end developers write code that runs on the server, processing requests from the client-side (front-end) and generating responses.

2. Database Management: They design and implement the database schema, create queries, and manage data storage to ensure efficient data retrieval and storage.

3. Web Application Logic: Back-end developers develop the application logic that drives the behavior of the web application, handling user interactions and processing data.

4. API Development: They build Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that allow the front-end and other applications to communicate with the back-end, enabling data exchange and functionality integration.

5. Security Implementation: Back-end developers are responsible for implementing security measures, such as user authentication, authorization, and data encryption, to protect sensitive information and prevent unauthorized access.

6. Server Configuration: They set up and configure web servers, application servers, and databases to ensure smooth functioning and scalability of the web application.

7. Performance Optimization: Back-end developers optimize the performance of the server-side code and database queries to reduce response times and enhance the overall performance of the web application.

8. Back-End Frameworks: They often work with back-end frameworks such as Node.js, Ruby on Rails, Django, or Express.js to expedite development and maintain a well-structured codebase.

9. Scalability and Reliability: Back-end developers design systems that can handle a large number of users and traffic, ensuring that the application remains reliable and responsive under heavy load.

10. Integration with External Services: They integrate the web application with third-party services, such as payment gateways, email services, and cloud storage, to extend its functionality.

11. Version Control: Back-end developers use version control systems like Git to manage and track changes to their code, enabling collaboration with other developers and maintaining a history of code modifications.

12. Error Handling and Logging: They implement error handling mechanisms and logging to identify and resolve issues, ensuring the stability of the application.

13. Continuous Learning: Back-end development technologies and best practices are continually evolving. Back-end developers need to stay updated with the latest trends and advancements in the field.

In summary, a back-end developer plays a crucial role in building the server-side infrastructure and functionality of web applications. They focus on data processing, application logic, security, and integration, ensuring that the web application works efficiently, reliably, and securely to provide a seamless user experience.
