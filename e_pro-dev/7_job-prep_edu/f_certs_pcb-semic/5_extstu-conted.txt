Hi Andrew,

The Undergraduate Admissions office would need to advise you about pursuing another undergraduate degree.

========================================================================================
Since you already have a Bachelor degree, you may want to consider taking courses through UCR Extension.  This way you can demonstrate the ability to do well and also develop relationships with professors who can recommend you for a graduate program. We recommend that you reach out to the graduate programs that interest you to have a more in-depth discussion to develop a plan that would increase your chances of being accepted into the program.
========================================================================================


Thank you,


UCR Graduate Admissions
