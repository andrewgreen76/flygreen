Does Go have a dedicated GC?
ChatGPT

Yes, Go (also known as Golang) has a dedicated garbage collector (GC) that automatically manages memory allocation and deallocation for Go programs. The GC in Go is responsible for identifying and reclaiming memory that is no longer in use by the program, thus freeing it up for reuse.

Go's garbage collector uses a concurrent, tri-color, mark-and-sweep algorithm. It runs concurrently with the program's execution, which means that the GC work is done concurrently in the background while the program continues to execute. This approach helps minimize pauses or interruptions in the program's execution due to garbage collection.

The garbage collector in Go is designed to be efficient and performant, aiming to strike a balance between low-latency garbage collection and good overall throughput. It manages memory allocation and deallocation for both stack-allocated and heap-allocated objects in the Go runtime.

Go's garbage collector helps simplify memory management for developers, as they do not need to manually allocate or deallocate memory. Instead, they can focus on writing code and let the garbage collector handle memory management tasks.

It's worth noting that Go's garbage collector is continuously evolving and being improved in newer versions of the language, so it's always a good idea to stay up-to-date with the latest releases for the best performance and features related to memory management.
