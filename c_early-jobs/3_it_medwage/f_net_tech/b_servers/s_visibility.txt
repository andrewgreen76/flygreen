VISIBILITY OF A NETWORKING DEVICE
===================================================================================

 . "A networking device is visible for a short period of time when it appears on the network (via ARP, DHCP, or
    discovery protocols) only briefly - typically due to intermittent connectivity, power-saving sleep modes, or
    temporary boot-up - before disappearing again."
