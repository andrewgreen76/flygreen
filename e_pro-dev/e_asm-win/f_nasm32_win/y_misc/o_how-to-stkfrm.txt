DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN SOURCES ON THE SUBJECT OF STACK FRAME MANAGEMENT 
========================================================================================

Consider how a stack frame is created :
 . pushing    old BP address 
 . rerouting  BP 
 . rerouting  SP 
 . `mov`ing   parameters
 . pushing    return address (implicitly) 
 . `mov`ing   local variables

How these are pushed onto and popped off of the stack really depends "on the specific
  calling convention used (e.g., cdecl, stdcall) and the compiler's implementation." 

"
If there are discrepancies with other sources, it's possible they are referring to different
  calling conventions or specific implementations. Itâ€™s always a good idea to check the calling
  conventions used by your specific compiler or development environment.
