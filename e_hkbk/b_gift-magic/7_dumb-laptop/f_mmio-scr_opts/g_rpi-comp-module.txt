Yes, there are single-board computers (SBCs) and microcontroller platforms available with sufficient power and memory to handle large display tasks without relying on a traditional operating system. These platforms are often used in embedded systems, digital signage, kiosks, and other applications where the primary task is to drive a large display with specific content.

Some examples of such platforms include:

1. **Raspberry Pi Compute Module:** The Raspberry Pi Compute Module series offers powerful computing capabilities in a compact form factor. It can be used to drive large displays with custom software developed using libraries such as OpenGL or directly interfacing with the display hardware.

2. **BeagleBone Black:** The BeagleBone Black is another popular SBC with sufficient processing power and memory to handle display tasks. It can run custom firmware or bare-metal applications tailored to the specific display requirements.

3. **Arduino Due:** While microcontrollers like the Arduino Due have limited resources compared to SBCs, they can still handle certain display tasks. They are suitable for driving smaller displays or simple graphics interfaces.

4. **Microcontroller-based Display Controllers:** Some microcontroller platforms, such as those based on ARM Cortex-M processors, offer dedicated display controller peripherals and sufficient memory to drive large displays without the need for a full-fledged operating system.

When using these platforms for large display tasks without an operating system, developers typically write custom firmware or bare-metal applications tailored to the specific requirements of the display. This approach allows for efficient resource utilization and precise control over the display output. Additionally, developers may use specialized libraries or frameworks for graphics rendering and user interface design, depending on the complexity of the display content.

Yes, there are single-board computers (SBCs) or system-on-chip (SoC) boards that can boot directly from their onboard storage, such as an EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory), without the need for a separate microSD card or external storage device. One example of such a board is the Raspberry Pi Compute Module.

The Raspberry Pi Compute Module (CM) is designed for industrial and commercial applications where customization and integration into other hardware are common requirements. It features an onboard eMMC (Embedded MultiMediaCard) flash storage instead of relying on a microSD card for storage and booting.

Here's how the Raspberry Pi Compute Module works:

1. **Onboard eMMC**: The Compute Module contains onboard eMMC storage, which can store the operating system and other necessary files.

2. **Boot Options**: The Compute Module can be configured to boot directly from the onboard eMMC storage, eliminating the need for a separate microSD card.

3. **Customization**: Developers can customize the operating system and software to be flashed onto the eMMC storage according to their specific requirements.

4. **Integration**: The Compute Module is designed to be integrated into custom hardware designs, allowing for a wide range of applications.

5. **Programming**: The Compute Module can be programmed to automatically display whatever content is stored in its onboard storage upon booting.

Other SBCs or SoC boards designed for industrial or embedded applications may also offer similar capabilities, allowing for booting directly from onboard storage like an EEPROM or eMMC. These boards are typically used in applications where reliability, customization, and integration are important considerations.

To hook up an eDP (Embedded DisplayPort) screen at home, you would typically need some form of a graphics card or a board that supports eDP output. Here are a few suggestions:

1. **Graphics Cards**:
   - **NVIDIA GeForce GTX/RTX Series**: Many modern NVIDIA graphics cards support eDP output. Look for models with DisplayPort outputs, as eDP uses the same connector type.
   - **AMD Radeon RX Series**: Similarly, many AMD graphics cards support eDP output. Again, look for models with DisplayPort outputs.
   
2. **Embedded Boards or Single Board Computers (SBCs)**:
   - **Raspberry Pi**: Some models of Raspberry Pi, particularly the Compute Module series, support eDP output. You may need additional accessories or adapters.
   - **NVIDIA Jetson Series**: Certain models of NVIDIA Jetson developer kits also support eDP output.
   
3. **Mini PCs or Industrial PCs**: Some mini PCs or industrial PCs come with eDP connectors, allowing you to connect eDP screens directly.
   
When selecting a graphics card or board, ensure that it has compatible output ports (such as DisplayPort) and that it supports the resolution and refresh rate of your eDP screen. Additionally, check compatibility with your operating system, as drivers may be necessary for proper functionality.
