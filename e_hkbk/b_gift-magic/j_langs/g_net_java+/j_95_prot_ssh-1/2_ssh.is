The SSH (Secure Shell) protocol was first implemented in 1995. It was developed as a secure replacement for older remote login protocols such as Telnet, rlogin, and rsh, which transmitted data in plain text, making them vulnerable to eavesdropping and unauthorized access.

The initial version of SSH, known as SSH-1, was developed by Tatu Yl√∂nen, a Finnish researcher. It introduced strong encryption and authentication mechanisms to protect remote connections.

In 1996, SSH-1 was followed by SSH-2, which was a significant improvement over the first version. SSH-2 incorporated additional security features, enhanced encryption algorithms, and improved key management.

SSH gained widespread adoption as a secure remote access protocol due to its ability to establish encrypted connections over unsecured networks, such as the internet. It became the standard method for secure remote administration, file transfer, and secure tunneling.

Since its initial implementation, SSH has evolved and continues to be maintained and updated. It has become a fundamental tool for secure system administration, remote command execution, and secure file transfer in various operating systems and network environments.
