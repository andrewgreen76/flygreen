HDL is :
- a FUNCTIONAL language and a declarative language
  = inputs are unknown, not given within the implementation 
  = it is purely about conditions and behavior, not dynamic data manipulation 
    -= no altering procedures going on ; everything is static
  = no code and data compilation or interpretation
