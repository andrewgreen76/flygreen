=============================================== USER MODE and KERNEL MODE ===============================================
=========================================================================================================================

The USER MODE and the KERNEL MODE
. exist to segregate user requests and the system-critical operations.
. in the user mode you can't carry out your own requests like I/O operations ... unless you make a system call
. system calls (e.g., read(), open(), exit() ) are user mode requests for privileged operations from the kernel
. privileged (kernel mode) operations include : 
  . working with a file system		/dev , /lib , etc. 
  . manipulating processes 		./ -or- SIGTSTP -or- SIGINT
  . talking to processes		signal() -or- argc/argv
  . setting aside more memory 		malloc() , free() , etc.

. C library calls (e.g., malloc() ) are NOT system calls. 
  . a system call does not need a library
