An instruction that performs an operation that does not involve data is typically called a **control instruction** or a **control operation**. These instructions manage the flow of execution rather than performing calculations on data. Common examples of such instructions include:

1. **Branching instructions**: These alter the sequence of execution, such as **jump (JMP)**, **conditional jumps (e.g., JE, JNE)**, or **call/return** instructions.
   
2. **No-Operation (NOP)**: An instruction that does nothing and is often used for timing, alignment, or as a placeholder.

3. **Halt (HLT)**: Stops the execution of the program, often used to end a program.

These instructions don't operate on data in memory or registers; instead, they control the flow of execution or the state of the processor.
