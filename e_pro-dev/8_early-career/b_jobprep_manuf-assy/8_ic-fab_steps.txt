KEYBOARD ENCODER IC (DIP-16 MM74C922 IC) - PRE-PROCESS STEPS :
======================================================================================================

 . silicon melting
 . removal of the ingot with a crystal (Czochralski process) 
 . ingot slicing - to make wafers
 . wafer polishing 
 . oxidation (applying water vapor or oxygen) - to create a film of oxide

Steps repeated for every set of layers (metal film layer , insulation layer , connection layer)
 . photolithography ("photo") 
    . coating wafers with photoresist
    . photomasking (application of a glass substrate w/ the negative of the circuit pattern)
       . helps expose the negative to UV light 
    . UV light application
       . "marks" the negative 
    . developer fluid application
       . eats away the unlit photoresist - the circuit pattern - leaving the negative intact  
 . etching - eating away at the oxide film - the circuit pattern - and THEN the photoresist (resist stripping) 
    . wet etching - using liquid chemical solutions 
    . dry etching - using gas or plasma
 () the Si IC is thinner than paper
 () connections will fill in the gaps later on - CONNECTION LAYER 
 () connections will be separated by walls of the oxide film - INSULATION LAYER
 () adjacent connection layers are shield one from another using a METAL FILM LAYER 

Making the material electroconductive : 
 . (vapor) deposition - of thin film - later to be left on the insulation 
 . ion application - introducing electroconductive ion impurities that are attracted to the silicon crystal
     (by way of dopant diffusion) through the oxide film gaps

 . metal wiring process - the gaps are covered with a thin layer of Al, Ti, or W , thus materializing the circuit's paths

KEYBOARD ENCODER IC (DIP-16 MM74C922 IC) - POST-PROCESS STEPS :
======================================================================================================
 
 . electrical die sorting (EDS) - chip testing (for dust particles , etc.)
 
 . slicing the wafer into individual chips
 . chip (die) packaging in resin/substrate 
 . bonding : the die and the package's substrate are connected together through their respective contact points 
 . injection molding
 . marking
 . final test
