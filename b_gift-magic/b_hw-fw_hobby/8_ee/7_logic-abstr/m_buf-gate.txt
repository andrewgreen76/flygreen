A buffer gate, also known as a buffer or buffer amplifier, is a digital logic gate that serves as an electronic component to isolate or protect one circuit from another. It is used to boost the strength of a digital signal without changing its logic state. Essentially, a buffer gate ensures that the output signal has the same logic level as the input signal, but it can provide more current or drive capability, making it suitable for driving multiple loads or long transmission lines.

A buffer gate typically has a high input impedance, low output impedance, and a unity gain (gain of 1). It is represented in logic diagrams as a triangle with one input and one output, as it doesn't change the logic level of the signal, but only amplifies it. Buffer gates are frequently used in digital circuits, memory interfaces, and signal transmission to prevent loading effects and signal degradation due to capacitive and resistive loading.
