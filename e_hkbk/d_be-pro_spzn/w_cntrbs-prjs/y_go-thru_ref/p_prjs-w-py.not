Certainly! Here are a few popular open-source projects that feature a substantial amount of Python code in their codebase:

1. Django: A high-level Python web framework that follows the model-view-controller (MVC) architectural pattern. It is widely used for building web applications and provides a robust set of tools and features.

2. Flask: A lightweight and flexible Python web framework that aims to be simple yet powerful. It is popular for developing small to medium-sized web applications and APIs.

3. Pandas: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library for Python. It provides data structures and functions for efficiently working with structured data, such as tables or time series.

4. NumPy: A fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. NumPy provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on them.

5. Matplotlib: A comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It is widely used for generating plots, charts, and other types of visual representations of data.

6. Scikit-learn: A machine learning library in Python that provides a wide range of algorithms and tools for tasks such as classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. It is widely used in the field of data science.

7. Requests: A simple yet powerful HTTP library for Python. It provides an elegant and easy-to-use API for making HTTP requests and handling responses, making it a popular choice for interacting with web APIs.

These projects have a large community, active development, and diverse codebases that can offer valuable learning opportunities and contribute to open-source software. Remember to explore their repositories, documentation, and contribution guidelines to find ways to get involved and contribute to these projects.
