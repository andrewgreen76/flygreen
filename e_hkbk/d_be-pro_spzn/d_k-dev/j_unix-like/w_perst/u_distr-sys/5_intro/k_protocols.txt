Protocol :
 . design (rules , specifications , principles)
 . every implemented protocol is designed for a specific purpose
 . examples :
    . Telnet - terminal access 
    . TCP - data transfer , NOT REAL-TIME (not live) 
    . IP - network addressing (assignment) 
    . UDP - resource-intensive REAL-TIME media transfer
    . SMTP - sending/receiving emails (middle)

       . Zoom chat
    . SSH - more secure than HTTPS 
    . Zoom proprietary communication protocol

 . each layers has its own set of protocols 


Stack (networking stack) :
 . a bundle of layers 
 . TCP/IP

    . transport
    . internet
    . link 
 . OSI model
    . application 
    . presentation
