WRITING TO A FILE : 
=========================================================================================

Writing a file is more costly than reading it :
 . time to dynamically update the dirs' inodes and the file inode
 . time to allocate space for the file
 . time to manage free space 

=========================================================================================

 . get the pathname
 -> open() - traverses the pathname
    . start at / dir
    -> read / inode (i-num = 2)
    -> loop :
       -> read dir data blocks -> look up child in the pathname by its inode
    -> check perm in leaf_inode 
    
    If good to read : 
    -> find the file
    -> alloc fd in the OFT
    -> ret fd_addr to user
    
 -> write()
    -> mark target d-blk in the data bitmap as used
    -> update an inode/bitmaps accordingly
    -> actual write - into the data blocks 

    -> read the 1st block
    -> update the inode (time last accessed)
    -> update fd in the OFT for future reads

 -> close the file
    -> dealloc fd in the OFT
