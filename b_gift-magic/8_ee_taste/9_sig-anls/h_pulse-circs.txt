PULSE-TRIGGERING CIRCUITS 
===================================================================================

 (a) AND-Q feedback delayed by inverters 
    . TTL exploit to create a voltage spike 

 (b) RC circuit - single pulse (peaks and subsides)
    . actually needs to resistors - one in series , one in parallel
