How do I do that in Ubuntu Bash shell?
ChatGPT

To write and run a "Hello, world!" program in Rust using the Ubuntu Bash shell, you can follow these steps:

    Install Rust: Open the Ubuntu Bash shell and run the following command to install Rust:

    arduino

curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

This command will download and run the official Rust installer script, which will guide you through the installation process.

Set up the environment: After installing Rust, you need to configure your shell to use it. Run the following command to add the necessary environment variables to your shell configuration file (.bashrc):

bash

source $HOME/.cargo/env

This command will make the cargo and rustc commands available in your shell.

Create a new Rust project: In the Ubuntu Bash shell, navigate to the directory where you want to create your project. Run the following command to create a new Rust project:

arduino

cargo new hello_world

This command will create a new directory named "hello_world" with the necessary files and configurations for a Rust project.

Open the main file: Use the cd command to navigate into the newly created "hello_world" directory:

bash

cd hello_world

Open the "main.rs" file in a text editor by running the following command:

css

code src/main.rs

This assumes you have the "code" command set up to open your preferred text editor or IDE.

Write the code: Replace the existing content of "main.rs" with the following code:

rust

fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}

Save the file and close the text editor.

Build and run the program: In the Ubuntu Bash shell, navigate to the root directory of your Rust project (hello_world). Run the following command to build and run the program:

arduino

    cargo run

    This command will compile the Rust code and execute the resulting executable. You should see the output "Hello, world!" printed to the console.

Congratulations! You have successfully written and executed a "Hello, world!" program in Rust using the Ubuntu Bash shell.
