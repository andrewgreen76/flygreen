link() :
 |
 . can make a file
 |  . creates a struct inode with metadata for the file 
 |  . ties that inode to the symbolic name given by the user  
 |
 . can create a hard link (alias/"copy") of the original file 
 |  . the original and the new symbolic links are tied to the same inode  
 |  . another symbolic name (provided by the user) is linked to the same inode 
 |  
 . link( const char * old_pathname , const char * new_pathname )
 . called upon by "ln" in Bash 
 . hard link ~= copy
 . An attempt to make a single change to the file under the hard link
   leads to creating a more recent , updated copy of the original.
    . Same symbolic link , different inode.

unlink() : 
 . deletes the file with the name provided in the argument
