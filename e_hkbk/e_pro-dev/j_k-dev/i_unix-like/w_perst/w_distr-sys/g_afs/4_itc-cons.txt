ISSUES WITH ITC 
========================================================================================

1) linear filepath traversal time is too great for the server : 
   . cumulative inode-table flipping on the part of the server takes a significant amount of time 
   . [multiple dir/file lookups per file path] x [multiple clients]
   => a deterrent to scalability 

2) overhead from "paranoid" issuing of TestAuth protocol messages 
   . you have to keep checking whether a remote cache copy has been changed ,
     thus becoming the latest "state" of the file
   . the expectation is for the updates to reflect in real time
   => a deterrent to scalability 

3) no workload balancing between servers
   . later rectified with volumes
   . volume
      = a logical storage unit
      . merely a chunk of data space with an arbitrary size 
      . can be broken up between servers
      - splitting is done manually by admins

4) no multithreading or multiprocessing involved to achieve optimal performance
   . only one process per client
   => context switching overhead + other overheads
   . later rectified with multithreading in AFSv2 


=> only up to 20 clients per server without server CPU bottlenecking
