The `<fcntl.h>` file, also known as the "File Control Options" header file, is a standard C library header file in Unix-like operating systems. It contains constants and macros that are used to configure and manipulate file-related properties and behaviors when working with files and file descriptors. This header file is particularly important for low-level file operations and I/O control.

Here are some of the common constants and macros defined in `<fcntl.h>`:

1. **File Descriptor Flags:**
   - `O_RDONLY`: Open for read-only access.
   - `O_WRONLY`: Open for write-only access.
   - `O_RDWR`: Open for read and write access.
   - `O_CREAT`: Create the file if it doesn't exist.
   - `O_APPEND`: Append data to the end of the file.
   - `O_TRUNC`: Truncate the file to zero length if it exists.
   - `O_EXCL`: Ensure that `O_CREAT` creates a new file (fails if the file already exists).
   - `O_NONBLOCK`: Set non-blocking mode for the file descriptor.

2. **File Status Flags (used with the `fcntl` function):**
   - `F_GETFL`: Get file status and file access mode.
   - `F_SETFL`: Set file status and file access mode.

3. **File Locking Flags:**
   - `F_SETLK`: Set file lock.
   - `F_SETLKW`: Set file lock and block until it's acquired.
   - `F_GETLK`: Get file lock status.

4. **File Descriptor Flags (used with the `fcntl` function):**
   - `FD_CLOEXEC`: Set the close-on-exec flag for the file descriptor.

5. **Advisory Record Locking Flags:**
   - `F_RDLCK`: Read lock.
   - `F_WRLCK`: Write lock.
   - `F_UNLCK`: Unlock.

6. **Other Constants:**
   - `SEEK_SET`, `SEEK_CUR`, `SEEK_END`: Constants for specifying file seek offsets.

7. **File Descriptor Duplicating Flags:**
   - `F_DUPFD`: Duplicate a file descriptor with a specific minimum value.
   - `F_DUPFD_CLOEXEC`: Duplicate a file descriptor with the close-on-exec flag set.

8. **Other Control Commands (used with the `fcntl` function):**
   - `F_GETFD`: Get file descriptor flags.
   - `F_SETFD`: Set file descriptor flags.
   - `F_GETOWN`: Get process or process group to receive SIGIO/SIGURG signals.
   - `F_SETOWN`: Set process or process group to receive SIGIO/SIGURG signals.

These constants and macros are essential for configuring file descriptors, managing file locks, setting file status flags, and controlling various file-related behaviors in Unix-like operating systems. Developers often use these in conjunction with functions like `open()`, `fcntl()`, and `ioctl()` for advanced file and I/O operations.
