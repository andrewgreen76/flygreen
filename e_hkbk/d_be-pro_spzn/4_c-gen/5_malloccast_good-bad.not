In C, it's not necessary to cast the return value of `malloc` explicitly because the `void*` pointer returned by `malloc` is automatically and safely converted to the desired pointer type. However, casting the return value of `malloc` is not an error in itself, but it can lead to certain issues:

1. **Hidden Bugs and Maintenance Challenges:**
   - Explicitly casting the result of `malloc` can hide bugs. If you forget to include the appropriate header file (like `<stdlib.h>`), the compiler won't be able to warn you about a missing declaration, potentially leading to subtle bugs.

2. **Portability Issues:**
   - Unnecessary casting can reduce the portability of your code. If you later change the type of the pointer, you'll have to update all the explicit casts in your code. Without the cast, the code remains more adaptable.

3. **Type Mismatch Bugs:**
   - If you cast the result of `malloc` to the wrong type, it might compile without errors, but it can lead to subtle runtime issues or memory corruption.

4. **Maintainability:**
   - Omitting the cast makes the code cleaner and more readable. Casting in C is generally discouraged when not necessary for compatibility or other specific reasons.

Here's an example of correct memory allocation without casting:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int *arr;
    size_t size = 10;

    // Correct: No need to cast the result of malloc
    arr = malloc(size * sizeof(int));

    if (arr == NULL) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Memory allocation failed\n");
        return 1;
    }

    // Use 'arr' for your intended purpose

    // Don't forget to free the allocated memory when done
    free(arr);

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `malloc` returns a `void*`, which is automatically assigned to the `int*` pointer without the need for an explicit cast. This code is clear, concise, and less prone to errors.
