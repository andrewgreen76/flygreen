In modern x86 processors, such as those based on the Skylake microarchitecture and its successors, a single processor (CPU) typically contains multiple cores, and each core can have multiple execution units.

Each core in the CPU is essentially a separate processing unit capable of executing instructions independently of other cores. Within each core, there are multiple execution units responsible for carrying out different types of operations, such as arithmetic and logical operations, floating-point calculations, memory operations, and more.

Having multiple cores and multiple execution units per core allows the CPU to execute multiple instructions simultaneously, improving overall performance and throughput, especially in multi-threaded applications and workloads.

Every CPU core typically has one set of general-purpose registers, which are shared among the execution units within the core. These registers include the likes of RAX, RBX, RCX, RDX, etc., and they are used by the core's execution units to perform operations and store temporary data during program execution.

Having a single set of general-purpose registers simplifies the processor design and ensures that all execution units within the core have access to the same set of registers. This design choice allows for efficient execution of instructions and ensures consistency across the core's operations.

So, in summary, while each CPU core may have multiple execution units, they typically share the same set of general-purpose registers.

In modern CPU designs, each core typically has multiple execution units responsible for carrying out different types of operations, such as arithmetic and logical operations, floating-point calculations, memory operations, and more. These execution units work together to process instructions efficiently and in parallel.

However, despite having multiple execution units, each core typically shares the same set of general-purpose registers. These registers, such as RAX, RBX, RCX, RDX, etc., are used by the execution units within the core to perform operations and store temporary data during program execution.

Having a single set of general-purpose registers ensures consistency across the core's operations and simplifies the processor design. It allows the execution units within the core to efficiently access and manipulate data without the complexity of managing multiple sets of registers.

So, to summarize, each core has multiple execution units but typically shares the same set of general-purpose registers.
