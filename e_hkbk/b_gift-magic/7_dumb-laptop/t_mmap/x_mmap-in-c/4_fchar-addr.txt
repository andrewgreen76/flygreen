In C, you typically deal with file offsets (positions within the file) rather than absolute memory addresses. However, if you need the absolute memory address of a byte within a file, you would have to map the file into memory using memory-mapping techniques like `mmap()` in Unix-like systems or `CreateFileMapping()` in Windows.

Here's a simplified example using `mmap()` in Unix-like systems:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    // Open the file for reading
    int fd = open("example.txt", O_RDONLY);
    if (fd == -1) {
        perror("Error opening file");
        return 1; // Return error
    }

    // Get the file size
    off_t file_size = lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_END);
    if (file_size == -1) {
        perror("Error getting file size");
        close(fd);
        return 1; // Return error
    }

    // Map the file into memory
    void *addr = mmap(NULL, file_size, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, fd, 0);
    if (addr == MAP_FAILED) {
        perror("Error mapping file into memory");
        close(fd);
        return 1; // Return error
    }

    // Output the address of a byte (for example, the first byte)
    printf("Absolute address of byte: %p\n", addr);

    // Unmap the memory and close the file
    munmap(addr, file_size);
    close(fd);

    return 0; // Return success
}
```

In this example:

- We open the file "example.txt" for reading.
- We get the size of the file using `lseek()`.
- We map the file into memory using `mmap()`, obtaining a pointer (`addr`) to the beginning of the mapped memory region.
- We output the address of the byte within the mapped memory region.
- Finally, we unmap the memory and close the file.

Please note that memory-mapping files into memory is a more advanced technique and may have implications on system resources. It's essential to handle errors and release resources properly when using memory mapping.
