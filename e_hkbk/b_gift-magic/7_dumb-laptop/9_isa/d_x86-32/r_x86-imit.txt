x86 processors, which are commonly used in personal computers and servers, are capable of performing a wide range of mathematical operations. These operations include, but are not limited to:

1. Arithmetic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of integer and floating-point numbers.

2. Logical Operations: Bitwise AND, OR, XOR, NOT operations for manipulating individual bits within data.

3. Shift and Rotate Operations: Shifting and rotating bits within data to the left or right.

4. Comparison Operations: Comparing values to determine equality, inequality, greater than, less than, etc.

5. Conditional Branching: Executing different instructions based on the outcome of a comparison or other condition.

6. Floating-Point Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and other operations on floating-point numbers.

7. SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) Operations: Parallel processing of multiple data elements using instructions like SSE (Streaming SIMD Extensions), AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions), etc., for tasks such as multimedia processing, scientific computing, and gaming.

8. Transcendental Functions: Some x86 processors also provide instructions for computing transcendental functions like sine, cosine, logarithm, and exponential.

These operations are supported by a variety of instruction set extensions, including the original x86 instruction set, as well as subsequent extensions like MMX (MultiMedia eXtensions), SSE, AVX, and others, which have been developed to improve performance and add functionality for specific tasks.
