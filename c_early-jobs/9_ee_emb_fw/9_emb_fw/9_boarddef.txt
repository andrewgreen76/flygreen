A file with DATA / SETTINGS : 
 . like A CONFIG (constant calibrations stored in a file)
 . target board (processor family , processor (core) ) 
 . target's clock speed for operation 
 . SPI programming host's port 
 . target's pin mappings
 . etc.

This way everything will be done correctly.

"
A compatible board definition is a configuration file or set of parameters that defines a microcontroller boardâ€™s hardware specifications, such as pin mappings, clock speed, and peripheral settings, allowing development environments like the Arduino IDE to compile and upload code correctly to the board.
