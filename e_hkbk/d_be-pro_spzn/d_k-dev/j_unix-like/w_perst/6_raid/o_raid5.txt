RAID 5
===========================================================================================================

 . similar to RAID 4
 . but parity information is distributed across all disks instead of being stored on a dedicated disk
 + room for one more regular disk
 +> wider I/O throughput (better parallelism) 


Evaluation :
 . reliability - same as RAID 4
 . capacity - same as RAID 4
   . sum of parity information size across all disks = size of parity disk = (N-1)*B
