python has its rules/assumptions 
focus : python : -abilities
vm vs. container vs. qemu vs. docker vs. k8s vs. kvm 
learning points 
need qemu for hw ; linux kernel learning points
process isolation
study templates before jumping into Rust. 
photos : javaldx, etc.

Find a place for (Open)AI in my superstack. (Python to build a dumb mini-AI.)  
statically typed - determined/accessible at compile-time
dynamically typed - accessible during runtime. 
objects :
- structs :
  - organization,
  - (using ptrs to build and manip. data structures - not to be confused with structs)
    - data structures retain node organization
    - data structures retain their own organization
    - data structures help us use memory economically (keep us away from memory bottlenecking) 
- (unions) 
ptrs :
- problems w/o ptrs:
  - tying objects together to make structures
- purpose:
  - dyn.memgmt,
  - distant recall
  - aliasing ("I hate having to write the long identifier for the same object")
