What does an OS do ? 
- virtualizes resources
- manages the use of the shared physical memory
- handles concurrency issues
- persistently stores files 

==================================================================================================================================================

The main goals of any OS are :
. to maintain security between regular processes and system-critical operations 
. it works with hardware to achieve its security goals
  . the transparency rule :
    . a process can only access its own address space 
    . physical addresses are never disclosed to user processes
  . protection : processes cannot affect one another, intentionally or not 
  . efficiency :
    . space : allocate as little memory and disk space as possible 
    . time : take as little time performing tasks as posssible

... operating systems need to keep users from killing the processes of other users to maintain usability and security.

There needs to be a hierarchy of users where certain users are granted more privileges than others. Having the ability to give trusted users more power will keep bad actors from abusing the system.

At the apex is the superuser (sometimes called root). This user does not have any restrictions, which gives them tremendous power. With this power comes the ability to do harm as well. Access to this user should be highly restricted to increase security.
