===================================================================================
FPGA's :
===================================================================================

 . certain interconnects (lines) are programmed to connect certain gates , thereby simulating a digital circuit
 . cannot simulate analog IC's 


===================================================================================
NON-FPGA's :
===================================================================================

 . fixed digital logic

 . "ICs that are not FPGAs include
    . **analog [/] power management ICs**,
    . **memory ICs** (such as DRAM or EEPROM), and
    . **application-specific ICs** (ASICs)
    "
    . CPU's
    
   
 . memory IC's :
    . operate on the concept of DIGITAL STORAGE , not hardware logic (digital logic) that is to do with CPU's 
    . simply store software , and that software would have logic of its own - software logic
    . memory is not concerned with logic of any kind 


===================================================================================
PROGRAMMING AN FPGA vs. PROGRAMMING A MICROCONTROLLER :
===================================================================================

Programming an FPGA - enabling certain interconnects between gates to simulate a circuit.
Programming a microcontroller - "writing" firmware (binary code) to the flash memory
