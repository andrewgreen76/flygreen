Caching a variable or an object can be done in various programming languages. Some languages provide built-in caching mechanisms or libraries specifically designed for caching, while others may require manual implementation.

Some popular languages and approaches for caching include:

1. C/C++: In C or C++, you can use memory management techniques to manually cache variables or objects. This can involve using static variables, global variables, or custom data structures to store and retrieve cached data.

2. Java: Java provides built-in support for caching through libraries like Guava or Caffeine. These libraries offer features like in-memory caching, eviction policies, and expiration settings.

3. Python: Python has several caching libraries available, such as `cachetools`, `redis`, or `memcached`. These libraries allow you to cache data in-memory or use external caching systems for improved performance.

4. Ruby: Ruby has caching mechanisms built into frameworks like Ruby on Rails. Additionally, there are caching libraries like `dalli` or `redis-rb` that provide caching capabilities for Ruby applications.

5. Node.js: In Node.js, you can utilize caching libraries like `node-cache` or `memory-cache` to cache variables or objects in-memory.

6. PHP: PHP offers various caching mechanisms, including opcode caching for improving performance, as well as caching libraries like `Symfony Cache` or `Memcached` for data caching.

It's important to note that the choice of language and caching approach depends on the specific requirements of your application, the available libraries or frameworks, and the desired performance optimizations.
