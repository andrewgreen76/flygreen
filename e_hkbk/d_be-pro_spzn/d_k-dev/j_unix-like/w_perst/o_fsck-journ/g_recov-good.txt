JOURNALING TRANSACTIONS - SUCCESSFUL RECOVERY : 
============================================================================================

Transaction - an atomic routine.

 . log intended write-ops into the journal 
 -> checkpointing tactics :
     . putting up key progress spots in the journal to help expedite potential replay  
     . snapshot (copy) of the target data blocks 
 -> commence actual write to the d-blocks in FS ...
    ...
    ...
    [transaction (not) marked as completed]
    ...
    [crash/outage]
    ...
    ...
 -> recovery : FS will track completed write-ops
 -> depending on the design , the stage to completion , and the transaction commit status (reached finish line or not) ,
    FS will roll back (revert) or replay (re-enact) the logged operations and commit the changes 
     . finish line NOT reached => revert to the last checkpoint  
     . finish line reached	=> replay
