
			Design challenges / Priorities: 
________________________________________________________________________________

Every single thing on the list below will have a dedicated creative module -- 
 -- design section and development tools. Listed in order from most to least 
important: 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Music 
 + quantity; quality by UI 
 + music production and reproduction 

Sounds 
 + for actions
 + game events
 + ambient sounds 
 + sound production and reproduction 

Stories / illustrations 
 + story-writing techniques 
 + illustration aesthetic 

Look and feel (for menus, gameplay, etc.): 
 + resolution aesthetic 
 + color schemes 
 + misc. 

I/O (keyboard only, types of strokes; mouse - later project) 
 + UI-based (menu, gameplay, etc.)
 + up/down/left/right/select 


Game state management (object): 
 + condWin object , condLoss object , condPreEnd
 + table container, tile by tile 
   = tile structure - thus generated and memorized 
     +=== interactivity: ====
     += obst flag 
     += grdLvl (terrain) type: grass, dirt, g-d mix, water, snow, sand 
     += We are NOT doing complex tilesets for better immersion. 
     += objOnTop types: item / agent / construction 
     += .
     +====== visual: ========
     += shown flag 
 + in-game interface elements 
   = panels and menus 
   = maxi-map 
     += screen focus 
   = mini-map 
 + music / player module 
 + (opt.: map mode, i.e. adventure vs. combat) 
 + "fancy" reactive mechanics, effects, etc. (disappearance, surge of score, etc.) 


Acquisition & growth aspect - a satisfying experience: 
 + look and feel 
 + associated mini-events (sound/music, visuals, etc.) 
 + reward and punishment: 
   = abilities 
   = opportunities 
   = enhancements through stats, etc. 
   = expansion & influence 
   = associated scoring system 
   = sound and visual effects 

Animation ticking: 
 + original ASCII chars and variations 
 + clocking rate 

Scrolling 

Save/load mechanics 

Combat

Map mode (adventure vs. combat) 

Scenarios 

Quests (and quest types) 

Single player vs. multiplayer (HCI) 

Portability 
 + for Windows, Linux, MS-DOS, Mac OS X 
 + re-writing from scratch vs. macro-based OS check 

Debugging techniques and integrity checks
