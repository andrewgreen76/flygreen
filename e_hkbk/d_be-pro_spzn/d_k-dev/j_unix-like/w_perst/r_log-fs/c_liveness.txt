BLOCK LIVENESS : 
================================================================================

 . status of the block (old or live)


In LFS :
 . every block has a dedicated segment
 . every block segment has a head
 . the head contains the segment summary block (SS) 
 . the segment summary block has : 
    + i-number 
    + offset


Block liveness determination procedure :
 . get the block's current location (C)
 . get the file's i-number (from SS)
 . get the block's offset within the file (from SS) 
 . feed the i-number to the imap , get the file's disk location
 . use the offset to calculate the block's disk location (O) 
 . match the locations
    . if O == C , the block is live
    . if O =/= C , the old-version block needs to be cleaned
    -> live block is detected
    -> its version is incremented 
    -> imap is updated
