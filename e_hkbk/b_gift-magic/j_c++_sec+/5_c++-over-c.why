Better data hiding through abstaction / high modularity.
- How?
- 
Better type checking:
- How?
-
STL
- Why?

- Why better memgmt?
-
Exception handling:
-
Auto-rsrc mgmt:
- constructors, destructors
- smart pointers (automatic mem release, preventing mem leaks and dangling ptrs)
- raii (resource acquisition is initialization)
- containers (std::string, std::vector)
