What is a large language model?
ChatGPT

A large language model (LLM) refers to an advanced artificial intelligence model designed to understand and generate human-like text. It leverages deep learning techniques and vast amounts of training data to learn patterns, relationships, and context from the text. LLMs are capable of performing a wide range of language-related tasks, such as answering questions, providing explanations, generating text, language translation, sentiment analysis, and more.

These models are trained on massive datasets, typically consisting of billions or even trillions of words, enabling them to acquire a broad understanding of language and generate coherent and contextually relevant responses. Examples of popular large language models include GPT-3, GPT-2, and BERT. These models have revolutionized natural language processing and have applications in various fields, including chatbots, virtual assistants, content generation, and language understanding tasks.
