Email client (domain) of choice :
- Each email client has its own nn's (news networks, or backend(s)) responsible for its functionality.
- A backend is like a class for building an instance meant to adapt some independent package's functionality for a mail client. 
- Every backend requires its respective package to be installed.

Gnus - backends :
