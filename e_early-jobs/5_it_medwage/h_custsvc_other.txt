===================================================================================

Triage :
 . "... is the process of quickly assessing, PRIORITIZING, AND ROUTING ISSUES BASED ON URGENCY AND IMPACT." 
To route issues :
 . "... direct[ing] support requests to the appropriate team, system, or individual best equipped to resolve them." 


Transactional user base :
 . "... users who interact with a product or service mainly for single, short-term, or one-off transactions
    rather than ongoing engagement or relationships."
 . that's when you "break or build trust"


When the user is NOT heeding your detailed instructions :
 . EXPLAIN TO THEM WHAT WILL GO RIGHT OR WRONG whether or not they do something
 . "Do this right and ... . Do this wrong and ... ." 


Dealing with someone who wants to bend the rules :
 . first , ENSURE THAT THE DETERRENT IS IN FACT COMPANY POLICY 
 . [time-consuming] if it is spelled out in writing , point it out to the user
 . if not , speak to the people about to get a definitive answer
