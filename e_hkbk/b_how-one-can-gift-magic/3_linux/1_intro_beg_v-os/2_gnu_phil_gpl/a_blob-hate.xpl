Why does the GNU community express aversion to blobs?
ChatGPT

The GNU community, which advocates for free software and open-source principles, generally expresses aversion to blobs (binary blobs) due to several reasons:

    Lack of Transparency: Blobs are binary-only pieces of software that are distributed without their source code. This lack of transparency goes against the principles of free software, which promote the ability to study and modify the code.

    Restricted User Control: Blobs often come with restrictive licenses that limit what users can do with them. This restricts user freedom to use, modify, and redistribute the software as they wish.

    Security and Trust: Without access to the source code, users cannot independently review the software for security vulnerabilities or backdoors. Relying on binary blobs raises concerns about the trustworthiness and integrity of the software.

    Dependency on Proprietary Components: Inclusion of blobs can result in a system that depends on closed-source, proprietary components. This undermines the goals of the free software movement, which aims for a fully free and open software ecosystem.

The GNU project and the Free Software Foundation (FSF) emphasize the importance of software freedom and strive to promote the use of free software that respects users' rights to study, modify, and distribute the code. They encourage the use of open-source drivers and firmware that can be audited, modified, and distributed freely.

It's worth noting that the aversion to blobs is not universal, and there are cases where proprietary software or firmware may be necessary for certain hardware to function properly. However, the GNU community encourages developers and hardware manufacturers to prioritize the use of free and open-source software whenever feasible.
