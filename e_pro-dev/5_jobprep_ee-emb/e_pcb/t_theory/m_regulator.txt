Voltage regulator is : 
 . "A voltage regulator is an electronic component that maintains a constant output voltage regardless
    of variations in input voltage or load conditions, ensuring stable power supply to sensitive components."


Method of operation :
 . "A voltage regulator achieves stable output by adjusting the current flow through a feedback mechanism
    that compares the output voltage to a reference voltage and compensates for any fluctuations in the input
    or load."
 . "Compensation takes place through the regulator's feedback loop, where changes in output voltage are sensed,
    and the control circuitry adjusts the pass element (like a transistor) to increase or decrease current,
    keeping the output voltage stable."
