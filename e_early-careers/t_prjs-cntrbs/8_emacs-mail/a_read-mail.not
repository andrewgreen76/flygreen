Reading emails :

---------------------------
Using notmuch and Emacs : 
---------------------------

Yes, there is a Notmuch command that allows you to display an email within Emacs. The command is called `notmuch-show`.

The `notmuch-show` command is used to display the contents of an email, showing the headers, body, attachments, and related information. It's similar to viewing an individual email in a traditional email client. You can navigate through emails using the `notmuch-show` interface, read the email's content, view attachments, and perform various actions on the email.

Here's how you can use the `notmuch-show` command in Emacs:

1. Open Emacs.

2. Press `M-x` (Alt key + x).

3. Type `notmuch-show` and press Enter.

4. You'll be prompted to enter a search query to specify the email you want to display. You can use various search terms, such as sender's email address, subject, or other keywords.

5. Select the email you want to display from the search results, and the `notmuch-show` interface will open, showing the email's contents.

6. Inside the `notmuch-show` buffer, you can use keyboard shortcuts to navigate, read, and perform actions on the email. For example, you can use `n` to go to the next email, `p` to go to the previous email, and `q` to quit the `notmuch-show` buffer.

Remember that `notmuch-show` provides a rich interface for viewing and interacting with individual emails directly within Emacs. It's a powerful tool for email management if you prefer to work within your Emacs environment.
