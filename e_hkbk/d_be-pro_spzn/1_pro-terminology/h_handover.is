In software development, "handover" refers to the process of transferring a software project or task from one individual or team to another. It involves passing on the responsibility for further development, maintenance, or support of the software to a different group of developers or stakeholders. Handovers can occur for various reasons, including project milestones, team restructuring, or the need to involve different expertise at different stages of the project.

The handover process typically involves several key steps:

1. Documentation: The team or individual responsible for the handover creates comprehensive documentation that includes details about the project, codebase, architecture, design decisions, known issues, and future plans.

2. Knowledge Transfer: Knowledge transfer sessions or meetings may take place, during which the departing team or developer shares their insights, domain knowledge, and technical know-how with the receiving team. This helps ensure a smooth transition and continuity in development efforts.

3. Code Review: The incoming team may perform a code review to understand the existing codebase's structure, quality, and potential areas for improvement or bug fixing.

4. Testing and Quality Assurance: The receiving team may perform additional testing and quality assurance activities to ensure the software's stability and functionality after the handover.

5. Support and Maintenance: Depending on the nature of the handover, the receiving team may take over the responsibility of supporting and maintaining the software, including handling user queries, bug fixes, and updates.

6. Communication and Collaboration: Effective communication and collaboration between the outgoing and incoming teams are essential to clarify expectations, address questions, and ensure a successful handover.

Handovers in software development can occur between various entities, such as:

- Between development teams within the same organization, for instance, from a development team to an internal support or maintenance team.
- From an external development team (e.g., a software vendor) to an internal team within the client's organization after project completion.
- From one project phase to another, such as the transition from the development phase to the testing phase.

A well-executed handover ensures a seamless transfer of knowledge and responsibilities, reducing the risk of disruptions and ensuring the continuity of software development and support activities.
