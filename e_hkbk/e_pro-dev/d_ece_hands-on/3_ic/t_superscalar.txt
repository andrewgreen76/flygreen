In computing, a processor or architecture is said to be superscalar when it is capable of executing multiple instructions simultaneously within a single clock cycle. This capability allows for greater throughput and improved performance by exploiting instruction-level parallelism (ILP).

Key features of a superscalar processor or architecture include:

1. **Multiple Execution Units:** Superscalar processors typically have multiple execution units responsible for executing different types of instructions, such as arithmetic/logic units (ALUs), floating-point units (FPUs), and load/store units.

2. **Instruction Dispatch and Issue:** The processor can decode and dispatch multiple instructions from the instruction stream in parallel, sending them to available execution units for execution.

3. **Out-of-Order Execution:** Superscalar architectures often employ techniques such as out-of-order execution, where instructions are dynamically re-ordered based on data dependencies and resource availability to maximize parallelism and utilization of execution units.

4. **Instruction Dependencies Handling:** Superscalar processors include mechanisms for handling dependencies between instructions, such as data dependencies and control dependencies, to ensure correct program execution and maintain program order when necessary.

5. **Branch Prediction:** Efficient branch prediction mechanisms are crucial in superscalar architectures to mitigate the performance impact of conditional branches by speculatively executing instructions along predicted paths.

Overall, the superscalar architecture enables processors to execute multiple instructions concurrently, taking advantage of available resources and parallelism in the instruction stream to improve performance and throughput. It is a key feature in modern high-performance processors, including those used in desktop computers, servers, and mobile devices.
