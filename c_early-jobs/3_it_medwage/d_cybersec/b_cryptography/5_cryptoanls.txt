Cryptanalysis:
 . looking for hidden messages
 . attempting to decode messages


Frequency analysis:
 . studying the frequency of occurrence of a letter in a ciphertext
 . some letters appear more frequently than others
 . some letters are put together more often than others
 . "Frequency analysis exposes vulnerabilities by comparing the frequency of symbols in encoded text to known letter
    frequencies in a language, revealing patterns that help break substitution ciphers."
 => an old way of encrypting messages
 => not very reliable nowadays, substituted with math-based methods


Automated cryptanalysis in WWII:
 . The "Colossus" was the world's first programmable digital electronic computer.
