In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class attribute is a variable that is associated with a class rather than with instances (objects) of that class. Class attributes are shared among all instances of the class. They are defined at the class level and are the same for every object created from that class.

Here's an example in Python:

```python
class MyClass:
    # Class attribute
    class_variable = "I am a class attribute"

    def __init__(self, instance_variable):
        # Instance attribute
        self.instance_variable = instance_variable

# Creating instances of the class
obj1 = MyClass("Object 1")
obj2 = MyClass("Object 2")

# Accessing class attribute
print(obj1.class_variable)  # Outputs: I am a class attribute
print(obj2.class_variable)  # Outputs: I am a class attribute

# Accessing instance attribute
print(obj1.instance_variable)  # Outputs: Object 1
print(obj2.instance_variable)  # Outputs: Object 2
```

In this example, `class_variable` is a class attribute because it's defined at the class level, and it is shared among all instances of the `MyClass`. The `instance_variable`, on the other hand, is an attribute specific to each instance of the class.

Class attributes are useful when you want certain data to be common to all instances of a class, rather than being specific to each instance. They are accessed using the class name, as shown in the example.
