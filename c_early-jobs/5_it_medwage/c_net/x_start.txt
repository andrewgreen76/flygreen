YOUR PLAN AS AN IT SUPPORT SPECIALIST FOR A SMALL COMPANY
===================================================================================

 . IPv4 addresses are running out
 . IPv4 addresses are expensive
 . Will IPv6 addresses exclusively work?
 . Try non-routable address space (with NAT) 
 . Need a router
 . List the necessities: 
   . a contract with an ISP - (to deliver a link to the internet for web) service 
   . DHCP - for automated address assignment 
   . DNS - for fetching web content 
   . VPN - for remote access ... but with port forwarding (works with NAT, IP masquerading) 
   . a (?web proxy?) - for denial of request for content unrelated to work
