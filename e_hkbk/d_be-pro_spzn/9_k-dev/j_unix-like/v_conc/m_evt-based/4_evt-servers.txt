Multi-threading introduces complexities :
 . race condition 
   .> locks
   .> condition variables
   .> semaphores
 . possible : missing locks
 . potential deadlocks

================================================================================================

Event (if-then) :
 . an occurence in storage or network
 . responded to
 . something is event-based as opposed to unconditionally/persistently executing something 

================================================================================================

Event-based concurrency :
 |
 . server waits for certain events/requests
 -> recognizes event 
 -> identifies event type
 -> performs only the necessary actions
    . maybe initiating other I/O requests 
    . maybe scheduling other events 


 . relying on processes , never on threads
 
 . used in SERVERS
 . also in GUI apps and frameworks , but mainly in servers 



Event-based concurrency does away with multi-threading
