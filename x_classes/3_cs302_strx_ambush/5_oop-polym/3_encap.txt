Encapsulation :
 |
 . ITEM POSSESSION , STATE , AND BEHAVIOR in a COMPOSITE 
    . what states it can have , what it can do (think header file) 
 . we define boundaries (what we can't have , how we can't be , and what we can't do) 
 . we define how we interface with objects (surface interaction - with data hiding)
 
 . structs , classes , access specifiers (private , public , protected)  
 . union is a collection of items - not behavior-related
