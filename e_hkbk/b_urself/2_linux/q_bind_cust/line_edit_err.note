I wrote the "Custom keybinding for Alt!" line in a bash script and ran the script. The shell responded with "alt.sh: line 1: bind: warning: line editing not enabled". What do I do?

The error message you received, "bind: warning: line editing not enabled," indicates that the bind command you're trying to use is attempting to modify keybindings for line editing features in the shell, but line editing is not currently enabled.

The bind command for modifying keybindings is typically used in an interactive shell with line editing capabilities, such as the default Bash prompt. When running a script, line editing is typically not enabled by default, which causes the warning message to appear.

If you want to define keybindings within a script, you can consider using alternative methods or approaches. For example, you can create functions within your script and assign them to specific keys using the read command to capture key input. Here's a simple example:

bash

#!/bin/bash

custom_keybinding() {
  echo "Custom keybinding with Alt!"
}

while true; do
  read -rsn1 key
  if [[ $key == $'\e' ]]; then
    read -rsn2 -t 0.1 key
    if [[ $key == 'C' ]]; then
      custom_keybinding
    fi
  fi
done

In the above script, a custom_keybinding function is defined, and the script enters an infinite loop that waits for key input. When the Alt+C combination is detected, the custom_keybinding function is executed.

You can modify the custom_keybinding function to perform the desired action for your keybinding.

Remember to make the script executable with the chmod +x script.sh command before running it.

Please note that using custom keybindings within a script is generally less common and may not work consistently across different terminal emulators or configurations. It's typically more appropriate to define keybindings in the shell's configuration files, such as ~/.bashrc, for interactive use.
