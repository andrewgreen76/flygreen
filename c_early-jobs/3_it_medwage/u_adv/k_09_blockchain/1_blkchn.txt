WHAT IS BLOCKCHAIN
===================================================================================

 . for record-keeping
 . secure
 . DECENTRALIZED (unlike traditional banking, which is centralized)
 . "A decentralized financial service operates without a central authority, allowing transactions and record-
 |  -keeping to be managed collectively by network participants."
 . Think "remote".
 | 
 . "most notably in cryptocurrencies, digital assets, supply chains, and trustless transaction systems"
 . "a DISTRIBUTED DIGITAL LEDGER [system] that records transactions in linked, tamper-resistant blocks across 
 |  a decentralized network."
 |  
 . "Linked, tamper-resistant blocks are groups of transaction records cryptographically connected by hashes so
 |    that altering one block would invalidate all subsequent blocks."
 |
 . input data --> [hash function] --> hash
 . a hash is used in data integrity checks and tamper detection
 . "used by computing it from data and then later recomputing and comparing it, so any mismatch immediately reveals
 |    that the data has been altered"
 . "a hash functions like a checksum but is designed to be far more resistant to collisions and deliberate tampering."


Cryptography:
 . the practice of using mathematical techniques to keep stored/transferred private data secure
 . encryption
 . authentication
 . preservation of integrity of data
