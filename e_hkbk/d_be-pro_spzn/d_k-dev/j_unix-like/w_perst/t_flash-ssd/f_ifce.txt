	| SSD controller					|	| flash SRAM cells			|
	|  + dedicated device control logic 			|	|					|
	|  + FTL (flash translation layer)			|	|					|
	|    . converts high-level reads and writes 		|	|					|
	|      into low-level rd/wr/er flash instructions	+-------+					|
	|    . evenly distributes writes between blocks		|	|					|
	|      => those blocks will wear out at the same time	|	|					|
	|      	  (WEAR LEVELING)		 	    	|	|					|
	|    . guides page-writes in ascending sequence 	|	|					|
	|      => helps avoid program disruption		|	|					|

					SRAM :
					 . caching
					 . buffering
					 . mapping tables


What can boost SSD performance :
 + parallelized flash operations
 . inverse of write amplification :
    . multiple low-level writes (and other instructions) per one high-level instruction
