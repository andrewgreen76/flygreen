Control logic :
 |
 . IR 
 -> sequencer
 -> decoder
 -> control unit (with a word for the next clock cycle) 
 |
 . every single instruction {opd|opc} is buffered for a handful of cycles/steps ,
   mapped to a sequence of words , every cycle/step yielding a word via the control
   logic decoder 



 . the reset vector is the address of the first fully composed instruction to be executed
 . ... but the first things to be executed are actually MICRO-instructions - control logic signals
   for loading the reset vector's instruction into the PC :
