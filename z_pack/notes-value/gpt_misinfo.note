What is the -s flag for?
ChatGPT

Apologies for the confusion caused. I made an error in my previous response regarding the use of the -s flag with the bind command in Bash. I apologize for the misinformation.

In Bash, there is no -s flag for the bind command. I apologize for the incorrect information provided.

The correct syntax for defining keybindings using the bind command in Bash is as follows:

bash

bind 'keysequence:command'

For example, to bind the key combination Ctrl+Shift+C to the command echo "Hello, World!", you can use the following command:

bash

bind '\C-Shift-C:echo "Hello, World!"'

Again, I apologize for the confusion caused by the incorrect information in my previous response. Thank you for bringing it to my attention, and I appreciate your understanding.
