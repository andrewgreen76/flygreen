The `range()` function in Python returns a range object that represents a sequence of numbers within the specified range. It does not return a list of numbers immediately but rather provides a range object that can be iterated over or used in various operations.

The range object is a generator of numbers, meaning it generates the numbers on the fly as they are needed, which makes it memory-efficient for large ranges. This behavior allows you to work with large ranges without needing to store all the numbers in memory at once.

You can convert the range object into a list if you need to store all the numbers in memory using the `list()` function. For example:

```python
numbers = list(range(1, 6))
print(numbers)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

In this example, the `range(1, 6)` generates a range object representing numbers from 1 to 5 (inclusive). The `list()` function is used to convert the range object into a list, which is then printed to the console.

It's important to note that when working with `range()` in a loop or iteration, you typically don't need to convert the range object to a list explicitly. The range object can be directly used in loop constructs such as `for` loops, which iterate over the numbers as they are generated.
