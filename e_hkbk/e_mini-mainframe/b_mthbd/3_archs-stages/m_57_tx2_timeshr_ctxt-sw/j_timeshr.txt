Time-sharing is a computing technique that allows multiple users or tasks to share the resources of a single computer system simultaneously. By rapidly switching between tasks, the system gives the illusion that each user or process has its own dedicated resources, thus optimizing the utilization of the computer's processing power and improving overall efficiency.
