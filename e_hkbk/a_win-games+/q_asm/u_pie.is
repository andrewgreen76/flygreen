In the context of assembling and linking, "PIE" stands for "Position-Independent Executable." A Position-Independent Executable is an executable file format that can be loaded and executed at any memory address without requiring fixed memory locations. PIEs are designed to enhance the security of software by making it more difficult for attackers to exploit memory-related vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and code injection attacks.

Here are the key aspects of PIEs in assembling and linking:

1. **Address Independence:** PIEs are designed to be loaded and executed at any address in memory. Traditional executables may have specific memory locations hardcoded, making them vulnerable to attacks that rely on knowing the exact memory layout.

2. **Randomization:** To enhance security, many operating systems implement Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), which loads PIEs at randomized memory addresses each time they are executed. This unpredictability makes it harder for attackers to predict where specific functions or variables will be located in memory.

3. **Security Mitigation:** PIEs are part of a broader set of security mitigations designed to prevent memory-related attacks. Other mitigations include Data Execution Prevention (DEP) and Stack Canaries.

4. **Compiler and Linker Support:** To create a PIE, both the compiler (e.g., GCC) and the linker (e.g., ld) need to support the generation of position-independent code and executables. This involves using special compiler and linker flags.

5. **Usage in Security-Critical Applications:** PIEs are commonly used in security-critical applications, such as web browsers and server software, where protecting against memory vulnerabilities is essential.

In summary, a Position-Independent Executable (PIE) is an executable file format designed to enhance security by allowing the program to be loaded and executed at any memory address. This helps protect against memory-related vulnerabilities and is a valuable security measure in modern software development, particularly for applications where security is a top priority.
