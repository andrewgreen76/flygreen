FORMAL RELATIONSHIP IN APPLIED COMPUTER SCIENCE 
===================================================================================

 . between data types and operations 
 . how one item (token) makes an impact on another item 
 . how one item determines something about another item 
 . what is true(/false) about the two items 


Typical example :
|
"
An example of a formal relationship in applied computer science is the RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DATA TYPES AND OPERATIONS in programming languages, where specific types dictate the allowable operations (e.g., integers can be added or multiplied, while strings can be concatenated), ensuring that programs adhere to defined rules and behaviors.

Other examples :

"
While the relationship between data types and operations is a prominent example, formal relationships can also be seen in areas like database schemas and integrity constraints, where the structure and rules governing data relationships ensure consistency and validity within a database system.
