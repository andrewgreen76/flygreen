Library:
- object files linked together as an archive (extension .a) .
- a.k.a. static library.

$ ar rcs lib[imagination].a	1.o	2.o	... 
  - r - Replace (overwrite existing resource) 
  - c - Creative (allow for creating non-yet-existing resource) 
  - s - generate a fast-access index

$ gcc -o exec main.o lib[imag].a 
  - Do NOT use -c ; you already have object files generated that are to be funnelled into this archive.
