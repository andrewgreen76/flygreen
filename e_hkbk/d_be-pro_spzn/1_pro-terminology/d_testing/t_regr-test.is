Regression testing is a type of software testing that focuses on verifying that changes or updates to a software application do not introduce new defects or regressions into the existing functionality. It involves retesting the areas of the software that have been modified and ensuring that previously working features still perform correctly after code changes or updates.

Key characteristics and aspects of regression testing include:

1. **Automated or Manual Testing:** Regression testing can be performed manually by testers or automated using testing tools and scripts. Automated regression testing is common for large and complex software projects to save time and ensure consistency.

2. **Repetition:** It involves the repeated execution of a predefined set of test cases. These test cases are typically selected to cover critical and frequently used functionalities of the software.

3. **Selective Testing:** Not all test cases need to be re-executed during regression testing. Testers typically focus on the parts of the application that are likely to be affected by recent changes.

4. **Purpose:** The primary purpose of regression testing is to catch unintended side effects or defects that may arise due to code changes, such as new bugs or issues introduced by code modifications.

5. **Continuous Process:** Regression testing is an ongoing process throughout the software development lifecycle. It is performed not only after new code changes but also after bug fixes, enhancements, or updates to ensure that the software remains stable and reliable.

6. **Test Suite Maintenance:** The test suite used for regression testing may need to be updated and expanded as the software evolves. New test cases are added to cover new functionality, and existing test cases are updated to reflect changes in requirements.

7. **Integration with Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD):** In modern software development practices, regression testing is often integrated into CI/CD pipelines, ensuring that automated tests are executed whenever code changes are pushed, helping to catch issues early in the development process.

8. **Baseline Testing:** In some cases, a baseline or reference version of the software is established. Regression testing involves comparing the current version of the software with this baseline to identify any deviations or issues.

Overall, regression testing is a crucial quality assurance practice that helps maintain software stability, reliability, and quality as it evolves over time. It provides confidence that code changes do not introduce new problems and that the software continues to meet its functional and performance requirements.
