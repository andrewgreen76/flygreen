FAULT TOLERANCE (GIVEN A SINGLE ERROR) : 
==================================================================================

An error means we have a faulty disk (per the fail-stop fault model). 
 => we need to identify the disk
 -> replace the disk
 -> recover the data using ECC (with parity and XOR) 
 -> store recovered data on the good new disk 

==================================================================================
HOW TO IDENTIFY A FAULTY DISK :
==================================================================================

Automatically - RAID management software
 . since RAID is always connected to a server or a computer , that device will have
   the RAID management software that will point out which disk is faulty
 -> an admin will handle the problem 


Manually - an admin will detect the faulty disk :
 . the RAID controller simply signals that there's an error
 -> an admin comes over and looks into things (LEDs , etc.)
 -> the admin identifies the faulty disk 
 -> the admin handles the problem
