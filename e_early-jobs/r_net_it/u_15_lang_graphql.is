GraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that was developed by Facebook and later open-sourced in 2015. It provides a more flexible and efficient way to request and manipulate data compared to traditional RESTful APIs.

With GraphQL, clients can specify exactly what data they need from the server, and the server responds with only that data. This eliminates over-fetching and under-fetching of data that can often occur with REST APIs. Instead of multiple endpoints for different resources, GraphQL exposes a single endpoint, and clients can request precisely the data they need using queries.

Key features of GraphQL include:

1. Declarative Data Fetching: Clients can specify the structure of the data they want using a query language that closely resembles the shape of the data they expect to receive. This makes it easier for developers to request and understand the data.

2. Strongly Typed Schema: GraphQL APIs are based on a strongly typed schema that defines the available types of data and the relationships between them. This schema serves as a contract between the client and server, ensuring that the data requested and provided are well-defined.

3. Real-time Data: GraphQL supports real-time data updates through subscriptions. Clients can subscribe to specific data changes and receive real-time updates when those changes occur on the server.

4. Batched Queries: Multiple queries can be combined into a single request, allowing clients to retrieve multiple sets of data with a single network call, reducing latency and improving performance.

5. Introspection: GraphQL provides built-in introspection capabilities, allowing clients to query the schema itself and discover the available data types and operations.

GraphQL has gained popularity and is used by many companies and organizations to build APIs for web and mobile applications. It is particularly well-suited for applications with complex data requirements and those that require real-time data updates.
