No, `malloc()` is not limited to creating only arrays of things. While it is commonly used for dynamically allocating memory for arrays, it can also be used to allocate memory for a single object.

The `malloc()` function allocates a block of memory of the specified size in bytes and returns a pointer to the allocated memory. This memory can be used for various purposes, depending on the needs of your program.

Here are a few examples:

1. Array Allocation: `malloc()` can be used to allocate memory for an array of elements of any type, such as an array of integers, characters, structures, etc.

```c
int* intArray = (int*)malloc(size * sizeof(int));
char* charArray = (char*)malloc(length * sizeof(char));
```

2. Single Object Allocation: `malloc()` can be used to allocate memory for a single object, such as a structure or a dynamically created object.

```c
struct Person* person = (struct Person*)malloc(sizeof(struct Person));
```

3. Dynamic Strings: `malloc()` can be used to allocate memory for dynamically sized strings, where the size is determined at runtime.

```c
char* str = (char*)malloc(length * sizeof(char));
```

4. Dynamic Data Structures: `malloc()` is often used to allocate memory for dynamically growing data structures, such as linked lists, binary trees, or hash tables.

```c
struct Node* newNode = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
```

In summary, `malloc()` is a versatile function for dynamically allocating memory in C. It can be used for creating arrays, allocating memory for individual objects, dynamic strings, and various data structures. The specific usage depends on the needs of your program and the type of data you want to allocate memory for.
