The behavior in keys is :
 - enabling behavior
 - doesn't matter which one, action 



- In an OR gate the switches are in parallel to one another.

Assuming a minimum of two inputs/switches : 
- One switch per pair of transistors (pmos and nmos).
- 6+ transistors
  = 2 two transistors / switch
  + 2 two transistors / switch
  + 2 two transistors / inverter
