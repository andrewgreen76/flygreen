						      First, let's lend our focus to a painfully obvious example of technology making no negative impact on human problem-solving whatsoever - the design and deployment of the assembly line. 
						      
   						      assembly line : a method of relieving boredom, not a case of making the mind dull

						      scripting : necessitated expedition of task completion ; somebody still needs to write that script ;
						      		while it may be important for us to have a way of solving a problem, it does not necessarily have to be memorized and mechanically executed ; being able to do the same complicated thing over and over is a rather moot point to make , a dull task to repeat, and the sort of thing that can be easily documented for later examination.

   	This is where technology is merely a means for achieving a desirable end. 

	The first thing that must be pointed out is that is 

	Now let's examine instances where technology	
 
	Lastly, let's look at




	Taking the bait of responding to this amusingly ambiguous claim, we can safely say that there is little to no correlation between leveraging technology and losing our ability to apply ourselves intellectually when it comes to solving problems. The collective strength of will of the human species took us so far that the author of this writing is not willing to entertain even the slightest notion of how adoption and refinement of scientific advancements have taken intellectual potential away from us. It must be noted that very little thought was put into composing the profferred claim; therefore, the author of this essay refuses to acknowledge any possible complexities of the subject matter. And now, with all that said, below are a few ways for us to be convinced that nothing subtracts from our independent problem-solving faculties in our engagement with technology.
