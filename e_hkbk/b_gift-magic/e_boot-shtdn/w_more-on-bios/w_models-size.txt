The size of a BIOS ROM can vary depending on factors such as the complexity of the firmware, the inclusion of features like UEFI compatibility, and the manufacturer's design choices. However, a typical BIOS ROM size for modern motherboards can range from 8 megabits (1 megabyte) to 16 megabits (2 megabytes) or even larger in some cases. Older or simpler BIOS implementations may have smaller ROM sizes, while newer and more feature-rich firmware may require larger ROM sizes to accommodate additional functionalities and compatibility requirements.
