In this example, the `add()` function is declared as `inline`. When the function is called in `main()`, the compiler will replace the function call with the actual function code, avoiding the overhead of a function call. This can lead to potentially faster code execution, especially for small and frequently called functions.

While inline functions can offer performance benefits in certain scenarios, there are several reasons why not all functions should be declared as inline:

1. **Code Bloating:** Inlining a function means that the compiler will replace each function call with the actual function code. This can lead to code bloat, where the resulting executable becomes larger in size, potentially affecting memory usage and cache performance.

2. **Compiler Optimization:** Modern compilers are sophisticated enough to optimize code without explicitly marking functions as inline. Compilers use various optimization techniques, such as function inlining, loop unrolling, and instruction scheduling, to generate efficient machine code.

3. **Readability and Maintainability:** Inlining every function can make the code harder to read and maintain. It can obscure the logical structure of the program and make it more difficult to debug and reason about.

4. **Binary Compatibility:** Inlining functions can affect binary compatibility, especially in libraries and shared objects. Changing an inline function requires recompilation of all dependent code, potentially breaking compatibility with existing binaries.

5. **Compiler Suggestions:** Compilers are often better suited to decide which functions should be inlined based on their size, complexity, and usage patterns. Modern compilers provide optimization flags and heuristics to guide inlining decisions.

Overall, while inline functions can be beneficial for performance-critical code paths, they should be used judiciously and based on performance profiling rather than applied universally.

Here's an example of an inline function in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Inline function definition
inline int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    int x = 5;
    int y = 3;
    
    // Calling the inline function
    int result = add(x, y);
    
    std::cout << "Result of addition: " << result << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```
