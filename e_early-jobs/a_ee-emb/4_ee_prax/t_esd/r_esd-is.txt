Static charge :
 . accumulation of charge through friction with any kind of fabric
 . any small charge can mess everything up 
 . static until discharged
 |
 . harder to build up in moist climates
 . easier to accumulate in drier climates 


Vulnerable targets :
 . integrated circuits (ICs)
 . capacitors
 . diodes 
 . transistors 


ESD :
 . "Electrostatic discharge (ESD) can silently damage or kill the functionality of electronic equipment,
      such as a PCB with a PIC10F200, even when it is not powered (i.e., not live), as the high-voltage
      discharge can degrade or destroy sensitive components like transistors or capacitors without immediate
      visible effects."
