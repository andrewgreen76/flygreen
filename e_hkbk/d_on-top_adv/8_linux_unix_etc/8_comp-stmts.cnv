In a Bash config, what do you call a block of code in curly braces and bookended with a token and the reverse of the token (like case {} esac) ?

In a Bash script or configuration file, a block of code enclosed within curly braces and bookended with a specific token and its reverse is called a compound command or a compound statement. The token used to define the beginning and end of the block determines the type of compound command.

In the example you provided, case and esac are tokens used to define a case compound command. The case command allows you to match patterns against a given value and execute different code blocks based on the matching pattern.

Here's an example of a case compound command structure in Bash:

bash

case "$variable" in
  pattern1)
    # code block for pattern1
    ;;
  pattern2)
    # code block for pattern2
    ;;
  pattern3)
    # code block for pattern3
    ;;
  *)
    # code block for default case
    ;;
esac

In this example, the code block for each pattern is enclosed within the curly braces {}. The case compound command starts with the case keyword, followed by the variable to match ($variable in this case), and the in keyword. Each pattern is specified followed by the code block to execute when the pattern matches. Each code block is terminated with ;;. The * pattern serves as the default case that matches when no other patterns match.

Other examples of compound commands in Bash include if-then-else-fi, for-do-done, while-do-done, and until-do-done, among others. Each of these compound commands has its specific tokens to define the beginning and end of the block.
