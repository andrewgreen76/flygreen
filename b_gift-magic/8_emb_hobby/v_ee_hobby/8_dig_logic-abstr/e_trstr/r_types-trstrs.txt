WHY DIFFERENT TYPES OF TRANSISTORS?
===================================================================================
"
Different kinds of transistors exist to optimize for specific applications, such as
 . high-speed switching (BJTs),
 . low-power amplification (MOSFETs),
 . high-frequency operation (RF transistors), or
 . ruggedness in power control (IGBTs),
each leveraging variations in structure, materials, and doping.
"

"
Ruggedness in power control refers to a transistor's ability to withstand high voltage spikes, current surges,
  thermal stress, and short-circuit conditions without failure, ensuring reliable operation in demanding power
  electronics applications like motor drives and inverters.

FinFET:
 . Fin Field-Effect Transistor
 . "FinFET is a 3D transistor architecture with a thin fin-like channel wrapped by the gate on three sides, enabling
    better electrostatic control, reduced leakage, and improved performance in advanced CMOS processes (typically 22
    nm and below)."


GAAFET:
 . Gate-All-Around Field-Effect Transistor
 . "GAAFET is a next-generation transistor architecture where the gate fully surrounds the channel on all four sides
    using stacked nanosheets, enabling superior electrostatic control, reduced leakage, and continued scaling beyond
    FinFET in sub-3 nm CMOS processes."
