Cache replacement
= buffer replacement
= removing less recently accessed entries (here: TLB translations)
  . "Of course, the idea is to reduce misses (or increase hits) and therefore improve performance." 



TLB replacement policies :
. least-recently-used (LRU) 
  . "... typically require maintaining and updating additional metadata to track the order of cache accesses."
    "This metadata incurs extra memory and computational overhead."
. random
. The larger the TLB , the more time-consuming and less appealing the LRU policy is.
