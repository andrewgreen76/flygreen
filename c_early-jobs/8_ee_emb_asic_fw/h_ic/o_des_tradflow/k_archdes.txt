ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN
===================================================================================

 . Create a high-level blueprint of the chip's architecture
 . Decide on the chip's overall structure and organization
 . Choose the necessary components:
    . Processors (CPUs, GPUs, etc.)
    . Memory (RAM, ROM, etc.)
    . Interfaces (e.g., USB, HDMI)
    . Other functional blocks (e.g., audio, video)
 . Define the communication protocols between components


Tools used :
 |
 . for system-level design and verification :		SystemC
 . for high-level synthesis (HLS) : 	    		Catapult or Vivado HLS
 . cycle-accurate simulators : 	  			gem5, SimpleScalar, MARSSx86
 |
 . for exploring microarchitecture, power, and area trade-offs - performance modeling environments:
    . Sniper, gem5 (with full-system mode), PTLsim

SystemC

"
SystemC is a set of C++ classes and macros that provide a system-level design and verification language.
  It extends C++ with constructs for hardware modeling and simulation, allowing designers to model and
  simulate concurrent processes and hardware components at a higher level of abstraction than traditional
  hardware description languages (HDLs) like VHDL or Verilog. SystemC is used for designing and verifying
  complex systems-on-chip (SoCs) and embedded systems.
