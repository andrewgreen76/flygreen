
Virtual machine (virtualization): 
 . a piece of software for creating multiple environments on the same computer.
   - hardware-dependent. 
 + faster than an emulator. 
 + allows for OS/software installation inside of it, ruling out the necessity for installation directly 
   onto the computer's hardware. 
   > virtual control. 
   > better back-up, recovery ; minimal risk to PC's hardware and software. 
 + allows for installation of other guest OS and VM. 
 + allows for navigation through "snapshots" / states. 
 + Hardware is accessed directly. 
 + more popular. 

 . runs on physical hardware, 
 . but relies on CPU. 
 . executes code directly with an interpreter. 

 - more taxing on disk storage (for permanent hosting), 
   . borrows (temporarily) huge amounts of RAM (for temporary use), 
   . taxing on CPU (computationally expensive and complex). 
   => runs slower than the real OS. 
   => will make the hosting OS slower because of borrowing CPU cores (temporarily). 



Hypervisor - realizes virtualization : 
 . software for creating and managing multiple VMs. 
 . responsible for sharing of resources with VMs.

Emulator (emulation): 
 . a piece of software
   + hardware-agnostic. 
 + light on CPU / memory usage. 

 . does not run on physical hardware, 
 . but does not rely on CPU. 

 - slower than a VM. 
 - need a software connector to access hardware. 
 - not as popular.
