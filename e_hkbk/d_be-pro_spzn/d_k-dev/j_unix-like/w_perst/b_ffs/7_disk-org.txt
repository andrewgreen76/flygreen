===========================================================================================
Recall the PHYSICAL ORGANIZATION OF A DISK :
===========================================================================================

 . every PLATTER has two surfaces
 . every SURFACE has thousands of concentric circles - tracks
    . modern HDDs have millions of tracks 
 . every TRACK has multiple clusters (arcs) 
 . every CLUSTER has two sectors
    . sector/block - smallest storage unit for a file
    . sectors used to be 512 bytes
    . now sectors are 4KB in size 
 . CYLINDER = stacked tracks from different platters make up a CYLINDER
 . cylinder group = stacked platters 
 . DISK = a set of cylinder groups
