The idea is clearer in visuals, featuring logistics, components, and protocols.

ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN
===================================================================================

 . Create a high-level blueprint of the chip's architecture
 . Decide on the chip's overall structure and organization
 . Choose the necessary components:
    . Processors (CPUs, GPUs, etc.)
    . Memory (RAM, ROM, etc.)
    . Interfaces (e.g., USB, HDMI)
    . Other functional blocks (e.g., audio, video)
 . Define the communication protocols between components


Tools used : "SystemC, high-level synthesis (HLS) tools like Catapult or Vivado HLS, cycle-accurate simulators,
  and performance modeling environments for exploring microarchitecture, power, and area trade-offs"


===================================================================================
SystemC
===================================================================================
"
SystemC is a set of C++ classes and macros that provide a system-level design and verification language.
  It extends C++ with constructs for hardware modeling and simulation, allowing designers to model and
  simulate concurrent processes and hardware components at a higher level of abstraction than traditional
  hardware description languages (HDLs) like VHDL or Verilog. SystemC is used for designing and verifying
  complex systems-on-chip (SoCs) and embedded systems.
