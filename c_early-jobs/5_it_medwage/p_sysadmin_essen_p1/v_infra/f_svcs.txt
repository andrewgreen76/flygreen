IT INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES - BASICS
===================================================================================

Infrastructure as a service (IaaS):
  . alternative to having physical hardware resources
  . receiving virtualized infrastructure services - compute, storage, servers, and virtualization of your own - via
    cloud from other companies
  . If holding and maintaining your own physical servers and updating their OS is too much of a pain, you can rely
    on other companiesâ€™ services to do all this for you.
  . You can virtualize and monitor their services to you via cloud.
 (a) AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
 (b) Linode - virtual servers for rent
 (c) Microsoft Azure
 (d) Google Computer Engine


  ! You must weigh all the pros and cons of employing and maintaining a service before committing to it.
    - gets more costly with every new user
    - You depend on another party for the services. So, if anything goes wrong, they have to fix it and you (just
      as they) are still liable for it.
