STATEFUL PROTOCOL : 
========================================================================================


Every individual client request is BROKEN UP into separate client-server transfer sessions. 


Idea for server's recovery from a crash - keeping track of data transfer state. 
 . state is retained by the client
 . shared with the server in the event of a server failure
 . simply called "shared state" 
 . a.k.a. distributed state


PROBLEM - example :
  |					      |---------- R E C O V E R Y    T I M E -------------|
  . file-ops sharing -> !!! SERVER CRASH !!! -> subsequent file-op/data packet transfer is missed -> server recovers
  |
  => necessitates a recovery protocol : 
    . server crash event : the client would have to keep track of the state (where the two sides are at with file-ops) 
    . client crash event : server misses a request anyway

FAST RECOVERY IN NFS : 
========================================================================================

Stateless protocol :
  |
  . a single one-way transfer packs all the info needed to fulfill a single client request 
  . does away with the overhead of tracking where the client and the server are at with file ops
