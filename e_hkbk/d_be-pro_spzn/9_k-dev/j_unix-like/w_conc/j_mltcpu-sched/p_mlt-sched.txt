Single-Queue Multiprocessor Scheduling (SQMS) :
 | 
 . all jobs across all CPUs are lined up in one scheduling queue
 . the queue has locks (one for the head , one for the tail)
    => bottlenecks
    => the more CPUs get lined up for the lock , the slower the system
    => tasks get moved between CPUs



Multi-Queue Multiprocessor Scheduling (MQMS) :
 |
 . every CPU gets its own queue
