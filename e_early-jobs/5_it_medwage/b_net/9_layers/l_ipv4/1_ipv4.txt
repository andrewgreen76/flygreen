IPv4 ADDRESSES : 
===================================================================================

    32 bits long , four octets (an octet is exactly 8 bits ; 0x00 -> 0xFF) expressed as decimals 
    Dotted decimal notation 
    IP addresses are easier to store 
    assigned upon connection , not determined by hardware vendors like MAC addresses are 

“What does it mean for IP addresses to be more hierarchical than MAC addresses?”

    “It means IP addresses are structured in layers (network prefix and host part) that reflect network topology, while MAC addresses are flat identifiers unique to each device without inherent location information.”
    i.e., MAC address - fixed ID unique to the device ; 
    IP address - tells you how to find the device ; it’s more hierarchical = more high-level , more flexible than the “grounded” MAC addresses. 


===================================================================================
IP ADDRESS OWNERSHIP : 
===================================================================================

    IBM owns every IP address with ‘9’ for the first octet (e.g., 9.0.0.1) 
    “The first octet only indicates the general address range (like Class A, B, or C in older notation) but does not by itself reveal ownership by a company like IBM.”
    IP addresses **belong** to networks in spite of having been assigned to devices.

“What does it mean for an IP address to belong to a network?”

    The IP address will be tied not just to the device, but also to the network , and it is assigned by the network. 
    A device can have a different IP address every time it connects to a network (even if it is the same network).
