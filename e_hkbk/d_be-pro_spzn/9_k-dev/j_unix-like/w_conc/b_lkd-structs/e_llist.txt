... if malloc() fails (which is a rare occurrence), the code must also release the lock before failing the insert. In this instance, the code must also fail the insert.


This type of exceptional control flow is quite error-prone.A recent study of Linux kernel patches discovered that such rarely-taken code paths account for nearly 40% of all bugs (indeed, this observation sparked some of our own research, in which we removed all memory-failing paths from a Linux file system, resulting in a more robust system).

The lookup routine is a basic code change that allows you to exit the main search loop and return to a single path. Doing so once more reduces the number of lock acquire/release points in the code, lowering the risk of accidentally adding errors (such as forgetting to unlock before returning).
