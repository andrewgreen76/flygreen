"
You may feel tired from motion in a vehicle due to **motion sickness**, which occurs when there is a disconnect between the visual signals and the balance-sensing system in your inner ear, leading to fatigue and discomfort.
"


"
The "disconnect" refers to a mismatch between what your eyes see (such as the movement of the vehicle) and what your inner ear senses (the lack of physical movement in your body), which can confuse your brain and trigger symptoms of motion sickness.
