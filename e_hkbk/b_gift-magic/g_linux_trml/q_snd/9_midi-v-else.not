MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) and WAV/MP3 are fundamentally different in terms of what they represent and how they work:

1. **MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface)**:
   - MIDI is a protocol for communicating musical information, such as notes, pitch, duration, and other musical parameters, between electronic musical instruments, computers, and MIDI-enabled devices.
   - MIDI does not carry audio itself. Instead, it carries data that represents musical notes and events. This data can include instructions for playing specific instruments, changing instrument sounds (patches), and controlling various aspects of music.
   - MIDI files are relatively small in size because they contain instructions rather than actual audio. They are often used for creating and storing musical compositions, which can be played back on MIDI-capable synthesizers, software synthesizers, or MIDI controllers.

2. **WAV and MP3**:
   - WAV and MP3 are audio file formats that store digitized audio waveforms. They contain actual audio data, including sound waves, sampled at various points in time.
   - WAV files are uncompressed and contain high-quality audio, making them large in size.
   - MP3 files use compression to reduce file size while maintaining reasonable audio quality. They are widely used for storing and playing back music.

In summary, MIDI is a data protocol for representing musical instructions and events, while WAV and MP3 are audio file formats for storing actual audio recordings. MIDI files do not contain audio data; instead, they contain instructions for playing music, while WAV and MP3 files contain the audio itself. MIDI files can be used to control synthesizers and generate music, while WAV and MP3 files are audio recordings suitable for playback on speakers or headphones.
