| JOURNALING , ATOMIC TRANSACTIONS , RECOVERY :						    |
|	     	    		   	    						    |
| . meant for recovery from interrupted write to disk ,					    |
|   not for recovery from interrupted atomic operations 				    |
=============================================================================================

 . ATOMIC LOG OF :
    |
    . [transaction descriptor block]
    . [target WRITE-OPS , metadata , data]
    |
    . checkpointing tactics :
       . indiv. trans. commits - key progress points in the journal to help expedite potential replay  
       . snapshot (copy) of the target data blocks
       
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 -> ATOMIC WRITE OF COMMIT BLOCK
     . all ops have been recorded
     . ready to update target data blocks
     
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 -> WRITE TO DISK
     . follows the journal (ops , data , etc.)
     ...
      [transaction marked as completed] -> [journal descriptor / commit block]
     !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! [ CRASH / OUTAGE ] !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 -> RECOVERY - ANALYSIS :
     . FS will track completed write-ops

 -> RECOVERY - DECISION AND ACTION : 
      . depends on the design
      . depends on the stage to completion
      . depends on the transaction commit status 
     (a) checkpoint NOT reached => FS will roll back (revert) to the old state -or-
     (b) checkpoint reached , finish line not reached => FS will roll back to last checkpoint -or- 
     (c) finish line reached 	 => FS will replay (re-enact) the logged operations and commit the changes
     	  . a.k.a. redo logging
