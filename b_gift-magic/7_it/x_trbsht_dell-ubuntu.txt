  journal. In that case, perform a soft reboot and you will end up in the HTTP(s) Boot mode.

  	   		. Hold Alt + HOLD PrintScreen/SysRq and don't let go, and the system will listen.

If that doesn't work, 	then it's probably because your machine cannot obtain the IPv4 address of the service since
  your router is configured to have DHCP fail to provide the address of the server with NBP. NBP (Network Boot Program
  helps with (a) booting the OS over the network and (b) reconfiguring your system's settings. So we'll have to figure
  that out.


If that doesn't work	(no solution was reached in hours), then powercycle your device. What can I say?
