The northbridge interconnects :
 . CPU interface 
 . the RAM controller
 . the PCI Express controller / bus 
 . video card controller
 . the southbridge counterpart 
 . "The northbridge is typically one physical chip, though in some architectures its functions have been
    split or integrated into the CPU."

"In some modern CPUs the Northbridge has been directly integrated into the CPU , so there isn't
 a separate Northbridge chipset."
