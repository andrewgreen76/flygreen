lsb-release -a

======================================================



You can use the `lsb_release` command or the `/etc/os-release` file to get information about the Linux distribution. Here's how you can do it using both methods:

1. Using `lsb_release` command:
```bash
lsb_release -a
```

2. Using `/etc/os-release` file:
```bash
cat /etc/os-release
```

Both commands will provide you with information about the Linux distribution, including the name, version, and other details. The output will look something like this:

```
Distributor ID: Ubuntu
Description:    Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS
Release:        20.04
Codename:       focal
```

Note that the availability of `lsb_release` and the format of `/etc/os-release` may vary depending on the Linux distribution you are using. Some distributions may have additional tools or files for providing this information.
