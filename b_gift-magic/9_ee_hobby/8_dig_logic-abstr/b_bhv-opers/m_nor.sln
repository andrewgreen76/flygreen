Assuming a minimum of two inputs/switches : 
- a two-input NOR is like a two-input OR but with an inversion
  = 2 two transistors / switch
  + 2 two transistors / switch
  + 2 two transistors / inverter
  + 2 two transistors / inverter, but do you really need this one ? 

  = 2 two transistors / switch
  + 2 two transistors / switch

  = 4+ transistors. 

- The behavior is : allergic to all.
- How is this useful ?
