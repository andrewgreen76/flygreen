TTL (TIME TO LIVE) : 
===================================================================================

 . NOT to be confused with packet longevity 
 . amount of time (in seconds) for which a name server gets to cache the resolution (again, IP addresses change regularly) 
 . TTL is determined by the owner of the domain 


In the past, limited tech meant limited bandwidth. So as not to waste bandwidth on full DNS (recursive) lookups TTLâ€™s were allowed to be days.
