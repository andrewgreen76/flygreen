CHECKSUMS - FOR DETECTION AND RECOVERY   
===================================================================================

Checksum :
 |
 |
 . a 4B-8B number
 . represents the state of the much larger corresponding data 
 |  . 1 memory block 
 |  . 1 disk sector 
 |  . 1 packet
 |
 . like a "summary" 
 |
 |
 =  f ( large data )
 |
 |
 + supreme error detection
 |  . missed by parity checks 
 |  . incl. silent ones
 |
 - resource-intensive 
 |
 |
 => more sophisticated than parity checks
