Visiting a web-page :
 . client formulates a request
 -> request is enclosed in a packet
    + metadata
       . IP address
       . etc.
       
 -> packet goes through underground copper wires
 -> packet goes through small regional networks
 -> packet arrives at a large local web-hub
 -> packet is redirected to a location by the IP address
 -> the hub launches the packet as light over fibre-optic cables to another hub 

 . the server makes and issues a copy of the webpage
