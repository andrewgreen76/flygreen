Give me an example of a small piece of code in the Linux kernel SCI.

Sure! Here's an example of a small code snippet from the Linux kernel that demonstrates the use of the Serial Communication Interface (SCI) for UART communication:

c*/

#include <linux/serial.h>

//...

void send_data(const char *data, int length)
{
    struct uart_port *port = ...; // Get the UART port structure

    // Loop through the data and send it byte by byte
    for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        // Wait until the transmitter is ready
        while (!(readl(port->membase + UART_LSR) & UART_LSR_THRE))
            cpu_relax();

        // Send the byte
        writel(data[i], port->membase + UART_TX);
    }
}

/*
In this code snippet, the function send_data is defined to send data over the UART using the SCI in the Linux kernel. It takes a pointer to the data to be sent (const char *data) and the length of the data (int length) as input parameters.

Inside the function, a UART port structure (struct uart_port) is obtained, representing the specific UART port being used. This structure contains various registers and memory addresses associated with the UART hardware.

The code then loops through the data byte by byte and checks the transmitter ready status (UART_LSR_THRE) using the UART_LSR register. It waits until the transmitter is ready for the next byte by using a busy-wait loop (cpu_relax()).

Finally, the code writes the byte to be sent (data[i]) to the UART transmit register (UART_TX) using the writel function.

Please note that this is just a simplified example to illustrate the usage of SCI in the Linux kernel and may not be a complete implementation. In a real-world scenario, there would be additional error handling, buffer management, and configuration code involved.
