CLOCK PHASES , TWO-PHASE CLOCK ON A 6502 CPU : 
========================================================================================

"
In the context of the 6502 microprocessor, PHI2 (often written as φ2) refers to the second phase of the clock signal in the processor's timing. The 6502 operates on a two-phase clock, where each phase of the clock signal (φ1 and φ2) drives different parts of the processor's internal logic.

During the φ2 phase of the clock, various operations such as instruction decoding, data transfer, and execution take place within the CPU. The φ2 phase typically follows the φ1 phase and helps to synchronize the internal operations of the processor. This two-phase clocking scheme is common in many microprocessors and helps to ensure proper timing and synchronization of the CPU's operations.
