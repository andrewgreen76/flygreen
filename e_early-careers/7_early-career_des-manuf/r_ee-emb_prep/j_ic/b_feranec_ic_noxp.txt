Robert made (multiple?) videos with Matt Venn on IC design:

IC design is a much slower process, as in between design and seeing the product work. You will also do a tiny part of a bigger whole.
From what I heard, universities are not the best places to learn electronics. A lot of (outdated) theory and little practical. Here in the Netherlands, the students need to do 'projects' in order to design a board. That project is a 'break' of one year.

As for PCB or IC - Yes, there is a difference in skillset and, yes, it is (almost) either or. But more importantly, which one would you prefer to do?
