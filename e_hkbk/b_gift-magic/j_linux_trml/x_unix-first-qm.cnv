No, Unix was not the very first operating system ever created. The development of operating systems has a long history, and several early operating systems predate Unix.

One of the earliest operating systems is considered to be the General Motors Research Operating System (GM-NAA I/O), developed in the 1950s by General Motors for their IBM 704 mainframe computer. Another early operating system is the Fortran Monitor System (FMS), developed in the late 1950s for the IBM 7090 mainframe computer.

Unix itself was developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s at Bell Labs by a team of researchers led by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie. It was designed to be a portable, multitasking operating system that could run on various hardware platforms. Unix gained popularity and had a significant impact on the development of subsequent operating systems.

While Unix made important contributions to the field of operating systems, it was not the very first operating system ever created. There were several earlier operating systems that paved the way for the development of Unix and subsequent operating systems.
