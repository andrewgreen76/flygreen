Eviction policy ideas : 
=====================================================================

Evicting a page :
. freeing a page or marking it as available in RAM 



Some lingo before we proceed forward :
|
. clean page :
  . a page read but NOT written to
  . no backup overhead
|
. dirty page :
  . a page written to
  . has to be moved/swapped into the disk for persistence (backup) 
  . reminder : every page has a "dirty bit" in its corresponding PTE
|
. cleaning a page : moving/swapping a dirty page into the disk (again, backing it up) 



When we have to come up with some available RAM , we need to be smart about what pages to evict.
Only some virtual machine systems follow the policy below : 
. a dirty page needs to be stored to the disk , or cleaned , so that it can be marked as clean before it is evicted 
. evict clean pages (we don't want to lose the changes on the dirty pages)
  . doesn't make sense to have clean-before-evict overhead 



. "the clock algorithm may be altered to look for pages that are both unused and clean to evict first;
   if those arenâ€™t found, then look for unused dirty pages, and so on."
