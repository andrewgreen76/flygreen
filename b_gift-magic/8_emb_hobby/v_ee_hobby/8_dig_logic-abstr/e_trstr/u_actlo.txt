Pins are often designed active-low (such as MCLR) because an N-channel MOSFET can pull a signal strongly and
  quickly to ground, requiring only a simple pull-up resistor to hold it high by default, which simplifies
  circuitry, improves noise immunity, and ensures a reliable reset or enable state if the pin is accidentally
  left floating or during power-up.
