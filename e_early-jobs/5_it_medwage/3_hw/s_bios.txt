BIOS
===================================================================================

Basic Input/Output Services :
 . has computer BOOTUP ROUTINES (INITIALIZING THE HARDWARE) , including power management tests 
 . works with DEVICES DRIVERS
    . services as extensions of BIOS 
    . software that allows the computer to understand signals received from peripherals
 . once an operating system is booted into , its kernel will take over for the BIOS in the way of CPU usage
 . there are native device drivers - stored on the ROM of the computer
    . In modern systems , the BIOS will have the bootloader (the software beneath it) handle the retrieval of
      device drivers from a storage device. (The storage is where the OS and the device driver files are located.)

 . the first routine BIOS runs
 . identifies the hardware in the computer 
 . checks whether adequate voltage is supplied to the hardware
 . will produce sound - beeps - to help identify the type of issue if one does occur
    . legacy computers will produce a single beep upon a successful boot ; two beeps for a booting failure
    . The beep codes will depend on the manufacturer. See the motherboard manual.
 . initializes the hardware - feeds off of the basic settings data on the CMOS chip to prepare the CPU , RAM ,
     and storage for work with an operating system (OS)
     . CMOS chip : hosts essential booting data - BIOS settings (date , time , booting methods , etc.)
     . you can boot into the BIOS/CMOS settings menu with the just right key 
 . loads in essential drivers - e.g., for operability with the keyboard , mouse , graphics card , monitor , etc.

  . a copy of something
  . in the context of IT , an OS (kernel code + modules + drivers)
