FSMs ARE USED IN COMPILER DESIGN 
===================================================================================

"
A typical practical example of applying the concept of a finite state machine in compiler design is the lexical analyzer, which uses an FSM to recognize tokens in source code by transitioning between states based on input characters.

 . current token type
 . the context of the last recognized token

 . "collectively influence how the lexer processes subsequent characters"
