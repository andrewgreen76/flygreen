Problem 1 : I want to avoid buffer overflow
	 ... but I also don't want to waste memory
	 ... because I don't like memory bottlenecking (that could make the program/system crash).


Problem 2 : I hate having to write out the long name of the variable in full.

Problem 1 : I want to avoid buffer overflow
	 ... but I also don't want to waste memory
	 ... because I don't like memory bottlenecking (that could make the program/system crash).

Idea :	 Adding things/objects as needed.
     	 But how?
Idea : 	 Having one thing "remember" another thing.
     	 But how? 


Problem 2 : I hate having to write out the long name of the variable in full.

Idea : 	  Giving the same variable/object a different, shorter name. But how do you refer to that object?

Idea 2 :  Remembering an object to recall it.

     	 But how? 

Idea 2 : Remembering a related object.


Solution:

Dynamic memory allocation : Allocating chunks of memory at runtime as needed.
Pointers are the glue that binds things together.



Problem 2 : I hate having to write out the long name of the variable in full. 

Idea : 	  Giving the same variable/object a different, shorter name. But how do you refer to that object? 

Idea 2 :  Remembering a related object. 

Solution:

variable aliasing
