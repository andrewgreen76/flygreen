Turbo Boost is not a clocking scheme in the traditional sense. Instead, it's a dynamic overclocking technology developed by Intel to increase the clock speed of a CPU beyond its base frequency under certain conditions.

When the workload demands it and the CPU's temperature and power consumption remain within predefined limits, Turbo Boost can temporarily increase the clock speed of one or more CPU cores. This boost in clock speed allows the CPU to deliver increased performance for tasks that require additional processing power.

While Turbo Boost adjusts the CPU's operating frequency, it does so dynamically based on workload and other factors, rather than employing a fixed clocking scheme like traditional clock generators. Therefore, Turbo Boost is better described as a performance-enhancing feature rather than a clocking scheme.
