Types of registers :
 | 
 . general-purpose registers :
 | . AX - accumulator , used for most operations , including holding return values 
 | . BX - typically holds the address of a variable or a procedure 
 | . CX - usually used for counting/looping 
 | . DX - typically used as a data register for multiplication/division
 | 
 . index registers (some think of them as general-purpose , some say they are specialized) : 
 | . BP - address of the stack frame for the currently active subroutine 
 | . SP - the "top"/"bottom" of the stack frame (where we see caller EBP , local vars , or params to deeper srout) 
 | . SI - address of source buffer (can be used in copying strings of bytes) 
 | . DI - address of dest buffer (can be used in copying strings of bytes) 
 |
 . status + control registers
 | . IP (control register) - holds the address of the next instruction to execute 
 | . FLAGS (flags register) - status flags + control flags 
 | . control : CR0 , CR1 , etc. 
 |
 . segment registers : 
   . CS - address of block with instructions 
   . DS - address of block with variables (tied to SI) 
   . ES - just additional  		  (tied to DI) 
   . SS - address of the stack
