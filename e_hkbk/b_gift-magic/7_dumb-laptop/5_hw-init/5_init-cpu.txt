All registers are cleared. Then , ... reset vector : 

0x0000fff0	 ; IP (fetch instr @ resv) 
0x0000f000	 ; CS selector
0xffff0000	 ; CS base


CS base    + IP         = resv
0xffff0000 + 0x0000fff0 = 0xfffffff0

CPU INITIALIZATION : 
========================================================================================

 . power-on reset signal
 . configuration pins
 
 . "... CPU initialization typically spans multiple clock cycles as various hardware
    components are configured and initialized during the system startup process."
    
 . the fetch operation is a microcode decoded into control signals that trigger a certain
   address in ROM ; the ROM then outputs the data at that address into the program counter
   
 . "... typically, the fetch operation, including microcode decoding, ROM access, and
    loading the reset vector into the program counter, occurs within a single clock cycle
    of the CPU."

MEMORY ADDRESS ASSIGNMENT : 
========================================================================================

 . "Memory address assignment occurs through a process of memory mapping, where specific
    ranges of addresses are allocated to different hardware components either statically
    through hardware design or dynamically by the system firmware during initialization,
    ensuring coherent and organized access to each component within the system's address
    space."

"
A CPU can be initialized without executing any code by configuring its internal registers and control units through hardware-based mechanisms such as power-on reset signals or configuration pins, ensuring basic functionality and readiness for code execution.
