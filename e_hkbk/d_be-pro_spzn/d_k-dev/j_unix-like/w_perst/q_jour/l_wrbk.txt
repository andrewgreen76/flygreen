WRITEBACK JOURNALING : 
====================================================================================

 . a variation on the ordered journaling mechanism 


Logging :
  |
  . [changes in FS] ---> journal 
 -> [   metadata  ] ---> journal
 -> [     data    ] ---> file in FS


  . CRASH -> metadata logging finished	  => FS is NOT recoverable 
  . metadata logging finished -> CRASH    => FS is recoverable
  . CRASH -> file writing finished 	  => FS is corrupted 
  . file writing finished -> CRASH 	  => FS is secure 


Characteristics :
 . recovery is NOT great
 . performance is great
