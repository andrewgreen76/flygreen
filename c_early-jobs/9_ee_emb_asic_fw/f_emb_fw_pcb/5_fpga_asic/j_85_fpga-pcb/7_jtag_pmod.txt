JTAG
===================================================================================

"
 . JTAG (Joint Test Action Group) is a standardized interface and protocol (IEEE 1149.1) used for testing,
     debugging, and programming integrated circuits, such as FPGAs and microcontrollers, by providing access
     to their internal components via a serial communication port using signals like TDI, TDO, TCK, and TMS.
 . JTAG connectors are for **programming and debugging**
 . A standard JTAG connector typically has **10 or 14 pins**, depending on the variant.

PMOD

"
 . Pmod connectors are for **general-purpose peripheral I/O**
 . A Pmod is a **standardized 6- or 12-pin peripheral module connector** used to attach sensors, displays, and
     other I/O devices to FPGA boards.
 . The Basys 3 board has **Pmod headers, a micro-USB port, a 3-pin UART header, a VGA connector, and standard
      2×6/2×7 pin headers for various I/O**.
 . On the Basys 3 board, **JA, JB, JC, and JXADC are Pmod connectors** used for general-purpose I/O, peripheral
     modules, or ADC input expansion.
 . **A Pmod like JA or JB is ideal** for connecting a tiny OLED via SPI or I²C.
