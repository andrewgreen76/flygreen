Let me rephrase it. When I run the emacs command with a directory name next to it and emacs runs du and ls subprocesses, where is the output printed?

Apologies for any confusion caused earlier. When you run the emacs command with a directory name as an argument and Emacs executes du and ls subprocesses, the output of those commands is typically displayed in a separate Emacs buffer called the "Shell Command Output" buffer.

The "Shell Command Output" buffer is automatically created by Emacs to capture the output of shell commands executed within Emacs. It allows you to view the command's output within Emacs itself.

After running the emacs command with a directory argument, you should see a new buffer open in Emacs, displaying the output of the du and ls commands. The buffer's name will typically be something like "Shell Command Output", and its contents will show the results of the executed commands.

You can navigate and interact with the "Shell Command Output" buffer like any other Emacs buffer. You can scroll through the output, search for specific text, copy the content, or save it to a file if desired.

If the "Shell Command Output" buffer does not automatically appear or you accidentally closed it, you can bring it back by typing C-x b (Ctrl+x b) to switch buffers and then entering the name of the buffer, which is usually "Shell Command Output".

Remember that the behavior of displaying output in Emacs can depend on your specific Emacs configuration or any customizations you have made.
