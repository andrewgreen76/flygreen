Keep in mind:

- "source_file_path" in shexe-sym-u.sh* really means the path to the location the link should take you to. 



shexe-sym-u.sh* does not like the following:

- ~/... instead of $HOME
^> Oh, and you can't do that either. You have to write out the "source file path" in its absolute form. 
- /. at the end of the "source" path
