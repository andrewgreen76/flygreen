Working on a project for company A using computers of company B can be a bad idea for several reasons:

Security concerns: Using computers that are not owned or controlled by company A may pose a security risk as company B's computers may not have the necessary security protocols or software to protect company A's confidential information. Company B may also have access to company A's data, which could potentially lead to data breaches or leaks.

Legal issues: Company A may be in violation of the terms of their agreement with company B if they use company B's computers without permission. It could also potentially lead to legal disputes between the two companies.

Technical difficulties: Company A may face technical difficulties if the software or hardware used by company B is not compatible with their project requirements. This could lead to delays, increased costs, and reduced productivity.

Performance issues: Company B's computers may not have the necessary processing power or memory to handle the demands of company A's project. This could lead to slow performance, crashes, and other technical issues that could negatively impact the project's timeline and quality.

In summary, it is best to use computers owned and controlled by company A for their projects to avoid potential security risks, legal issues, technical difficulties, and performance issues.
