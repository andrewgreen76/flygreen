  alternatives to unhealthy solutions, etc.) 
- (especially for beginners)
  - hone their programming skills,
  - internalize key programming and engineering concepts,
  - learn about different systems,
  - understand and build a perspective on modern computing through studying
    its history.

- boot order from BIOS to Linux/Ubuntu userspace on top of Wayland 
- compound statements in Bash configs 
- more Python ~~~~ obj attr error 
- Wayland vs. GNOME
- aliasing vs. building custom cmds into the filesys with execable scripts: .sh > shebang > chmod +x
- the MOSH protocol
- grid computing vs. cloud computing

- challenge: faithful resolution
- plan of attack:
  - fide: 320x200
  - now: 1920x1200, 6 times both ways.
  - consider fair, authentic scaling. 
- learn BIOS-kernel-API/DSP-distro ladder for that
