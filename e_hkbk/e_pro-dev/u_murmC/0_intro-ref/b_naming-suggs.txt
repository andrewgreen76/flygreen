Rule of thumb #1 :
 . Use '_' (underscore) if necessary.


Rule of thumb #2 :
 . You can use '_' to separate the ending noun from the rest of the identifier.
 . [..] spec_thing [..] 
 . Ex. : struct


Though datatypes can help with understanding the identifiers , I'd have
  to think that it's still good practice to give clear , descriptive names
  to variables , arrays/pointers , and structures.
