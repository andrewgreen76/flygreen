To distinguish between an **RS-232** cable and a **CAN** (Controller Area Network) cable by their connectors:

- **RS-232** typically uses a **DB9** or **DB25** connector, which are rectangular with **9 or 25 pins**, respectively. The pins are usually arranged in a single row.
  
- **CAN** cables often use **DB9** or **DB25** connectors as well, but they are usually identified by the pinout or their use in automotive or industrial applications. The **DB9** for CAN typically has a distinct pin configuration, and some CAN connectors use a **5-pin** or **6-pin** format (like the **M12** or **DE-9** connectors) for automotive or industrial CAN networks.

In summary:
- **RS-232**: DB9 or DB25 connectors, often used for communication between PCs and peripherals.
- **CAN**: Typically DB9 or other specialized connectors (like M12) with different pinouts, used for automotive and industrial networking.

Additionally, if you inspect the cable's labeling or documentation, it should indicate whether it's designed for RS-232 or CAN communication.
