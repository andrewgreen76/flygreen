Yes, you're correct. In C and C++, the combination of `#ifndef` (if not defined) and `#define` preprocessor directives is a common technique used to prevent multiple inclusions of header files and is an alternative to `#pragma once`. This technique uses what's often called an "include guard" to achieve the same goal of ensuring that a header file is included only once.

Here's how the include guard technique works:

```cpp
// myheader.h

#ifndef MYHEADER_H
#define MYHEADER_H

// Header contents go here

#endif // MYHEADER_H
```

In this example, when the header file `myheader.h` is included for the first time in a translation unit, the `MYHEADER_H` macro is defined using `#define`. Subsequent inclusions of the header will skip the block of code between `#ifndef` and `#endif` because `MYHEADER_H` is already defined. This prevents the contents of the header file from being included multiple times in the same translation unit.

Both `#pragma once` and the include guard technique (`#ifndef` and `#define`) serve the same purpose of preventing multiple inclusions of the same header file and avoiding related issues. The choice between them often comes down to personal preference and coding standards, as well as considerations for compatibility with different compilers and coding practices.
