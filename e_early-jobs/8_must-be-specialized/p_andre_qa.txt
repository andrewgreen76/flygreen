Andre',

Thank you again for taking some time to talk with me over the phone. Everything you said gave me a lot to think about.



Thoughts:

 - One takeaway I got from our conversation is that you want me to sacrifice the desire to learn as much as I can about general-purpose computers in favor of simply finishing tiny projects, projects I personally find very limiting in the way of scope, ambition. 

 - I think I understand why you want me to commit to designing something as small and aesthetically uninvolving as a tiny game console - because it is supposed to be the most primitive form of a game console, especially given the small resolution of the OLED. 
 
 - Though I have very strong reservations about the tiny gaming console (I figured that the moment I saw the thing), I am thinking about doing what you asked me to do. Three reasons: (1) just because you asked me to do it; (2) I don't want to pay you a dollar (even if we didn't agree on that); (3) simply turning it down would be a humiliating memory. I do fear, however, that I will end up hating a proj

P.S.: I forgot to mention that I also soldered-up the components to a DIY radio board with speakers and made it all work, but I guess it's kind of a moot point to bring this up.
