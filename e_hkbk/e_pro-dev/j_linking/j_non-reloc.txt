Yes, there are examples of code that is not relocatable. In computer programming, relocatable code refers to code that can be executed at any memory location in the system without modification. The ability to relocate code is important for various reasons, including dynamic loading of libraries, code sharing, and flexibility in memory management.

However, some code might not be designed to be relocatable for specific reasons. Here are a few examples:

1. Absolute Assembly Code: In some low-level programming scenarios, code may be written using absolute memory addresses directly. This means the code is tied to specific memory locations and cannot be moved elsewhere without modifying the code to update the addresses. Such code is not relocatable.

2. Inline Assembly: In certain programming languages, like C and C++, developers can write inline assembly code. If the assembly code references specific memory addresses or relies on fixed offsets, it may not be relocatable.

3. Hard-Coded Addresses: Code that contains hard-coded memory addresses or pointers to specific locations in memory is not relocatable. Changing the memory layout or moving the code to another location would require modifying the code to update these addresses.

4. Non-Position-Independent Code: In some situations, like certain embedded systems or specialized hardware, the code may be designed to run at a fixed memory location. This non-position-independent code is not relocatable and relies on being placed at a specific memory address during the system's boot-up or initialization.

It's important to note that most modern programming languages and compilers are designed to generate relocatable code by default to support code modularity, dynamic linking, and efficient memory management. Relocatable code provides flexibility and makes it easier to maintain and update software in various environments. However, there are still scenarios where non-relocatable code may be intentionally used for specific optimizations or hardware constraints.
