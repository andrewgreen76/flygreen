Dear Ms. Dashiell,

I sincerely hope your day is going very well. My name is Andrew Green and I am a grad special student at the University of Nevada-Reno. Your commitment to career advancement and improving the quality of life for your employees got me thinking that together we could definitely make some things happen. I firmly believe that EM Research seems like the ideal company for me to work with. I know for a fact that I have the skills in lower-level programming with C and C++, as well as the system administration skills with Python and Bash, that would prove me to be an immensely resourceful asset to your company.  

A little about me: I've been involved in an internship project targeting a progressive jackpot dollar amount monitoring system, having started life as a not very exciting project for Bally Technologies (see a recreation of the project at https://github.com/andrewgreen76/portfolio/tree/main/7_ocr-app_c), now a subsidiary of Light & Wonder, Inc. My job was to implement a text recognition algorithm for the project using my skills in C++ and OpenCV. In my spare time I work on far more exciting projects spanning across a number of disciplines such as operating systems development, game development, and building networking capabilities for my systems. I also spend time studying porting projects to Linux, mostly targeting the Ubuntu distribution. Granted, these endeavors have a way of stepping on each others' toes, but once you have me on board, there would be a far stronger sense of focus and direction, goals would be met, and - as cliche as this may sound - the world would be a better place once other potential candidates would see why our efforts could give rise to a great deal of inspiration. 

I am absolutely positive that these experiences would make me an exceptional candidate for you, especially since it is AI and robotics rather than system administration and operating systems development that bear a great deal of competition; after all, system administration and operating systems development happen to be strongest suit. The bottom line is that I am very interested in working for Actalent and can start working immediately. In fact, lucky for you, I am willing to relocate to any state within the country. Given the right circumstances, I would be flexible in the way of moving to a different country if matching positions demand me to do so. Please let me know if there's anything else you need from me. I look forward to hearing from you! I can be reached at andrewg.engr@gmail.com and (775) 762-5595.

Best regards,

Andrew Green
