Driver : 
 . in general , code of any size 
 . a very broad term ; using the word needs context 


Main driver : 
 . the main function or entry point in a program 


Device driver :
 . basically , software that translates code and data from system architecture to device architecture or vice versa 
 . translates data fit for a different architecture into data that the hardware in its own architecture can digest 


Test driver :
 . a program or script
 . pushes test cases and collects results 


System driver : see device driver 
OS driver : see device driver 
Kernel driver : see device driver

DEVICE DRIVER : 
========================================================================================

 . a.k.a. system driver 
 . a.k.a. OS driver 
 . a.k.a. kernel driver
 
 . on the system side : a program that allows the operating system (kernel) to leverage and manage hardware components and devices 
 . on the device side : a program that translates data fit for a different architecture into data that the device with its own architecture can digest 

Examples : 
 . graphics / GPU drivers , accelerator drivers (TPUs , APUs) , etc. - processing unit drivers , basically 
 . I/O drivers :
   . peripherals 
   . storage (e.g., a driver for a RAID controller) 
   . sound 
   . networking (NIC driver)
 . firmware-updating drivers 
 . maybe other applications
