n-bit RAM stores code (instructions) and data.



A RAM unit is a direct access logic unit :

      	      load
		|
	+-------+-------------+
in	|	w-bit reg 0   |
-/------+	w-bit reg 1   |	out
w	|	.	      +--/---
	|"mux"	.	      |	w
addr	|	.	      |
-/------+	w-bit reg n-1 |
k	|	      	      |
	|		      |
	+-------^clk----------+

Important facts to remember : 
- Only ONE reg is seld at a time.
- k = log2(n)
- RAM is a sequential chip.
