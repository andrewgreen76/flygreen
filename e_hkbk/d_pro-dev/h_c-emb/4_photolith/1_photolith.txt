Intel uses a process called photolithography, which involves projecting patterns onto silicon wafers using light and chemical processes, to physically scale down their integrated circuits and achieve smaller transistor sizes, enabling higher performance and increased density on semiconductor chips.

The miniaturization and integration of modules and registers into a die were made possible through advancements in semiconductor manufacturing processes, which enabled the fabrication of increasingly smaller transistors and circuit components, allowing for higher levels of integration and density on a single semiconductor chip.

These advancements primarily include innovations in photolithography, materials science, and semiconductor fabrication techniques, leading to finer feature sizes, improved transistor performance, and higher yields, facilitating the packing of more modules and registers into a smaller area on a semiconductor die.

... precision tools such as photomasks, stepper machines, and advanced optical systems are utilized to accurately transfer circuit patterns onto semiconductor wafers with sub-micron precision.
