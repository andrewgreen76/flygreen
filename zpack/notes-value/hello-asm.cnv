However, assuming we are talking about the earliest known Assembly language, a Hello World program might look something like this:\n\nSTART:      MOV     AX, 0      ; Load the value 0 into AX register\n            MOV     BX, 'H'    ; Load the ASCII code for H into BX register\n            INT     10H        ; Print the character in BX register\n            MOV     BX, 'E'    ; Load the ASCII code for E into BX register\n            INT     10H        ; Print the character in BX register\n            MOV     BX, 'L'    ; Load the ASCII code for L into BX register\n            INT     10H        ; Print the character in BX register\n            MOV     BX, 'L'    ; Load the ASCII code for L into BX register\n            INT     10H        ; Print the character in BX register\n            MOV     BX, 'O'    ; Load the ASCII code for O into BX register\n            INT     10H        ; Print the character in BX register\n            MOV     BX, ' '    ; Load the ASCII code for space into BX register\n            INT     10H        ; Print the character in BX register\n            MOV     BX, 'W'    ; Load the ASCII code for W into BX register\n            INT     10H        ; Print the character in BX register\n            MOV     BX, 'O'    ; Load the ASCII code for O into BX register\n            INT     10H        ; Print the character in BX register\n            MOV     BX, 'R'    ; Load the ASCII code for R into BX register\n            INT     10H        ; Print the character in BX register\n            MOV     BX, 'L'    ; Load the ASCII code for L into BX register\n            INT     10H        ; Print the character in BX register\n            MOV     BX, 'D'    ; Load the ASCII code for D into BX register\n            INT     10H        ; Print the character in BX register\n            MOV     AX, 4C00H  ; Set the program exit code to 0\n            INT     21H        ; Exit the program\n\nThis program uses the interrupt 10H to print each character of the message \"HELLO WORLD\" to the screen, one at a time. The program then exits with a code of 0. This is just one example of what a Hello World program in Assembly might have looked like in 1948."},"finish_reason":"stop","index":0}]}
