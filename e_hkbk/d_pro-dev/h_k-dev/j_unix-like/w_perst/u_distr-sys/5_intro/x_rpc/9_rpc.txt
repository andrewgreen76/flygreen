"Programming language abstractions make far more sense than OS abstractions for constructing distributed systems. The most common abstraction is a remote procedure call, or RPC."



====================================================================================
REMOTE PROCEDURE CALL (RPC) - ABOUT : 
====================================================================================

Shape/form :
 . select codebase from process API is bundled , copied , and moved in packets
   from the server's memory/storage to the client's memory 
 . there are RPC APIs that can help realize this mechanism 

Goal :
 . "RPC allows the invocation of procedures or methods on a remote server as if they were local"
 . consolidation and optimization of executing code of the process on the server-side 
 . the idea is to make remote access "as straightforward as calling a local function"
