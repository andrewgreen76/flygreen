Libreboot, an open-source firmware project, is specifically designed to support a subset of x86-based systems that utilize specific hardware and avoid proprietary components. Libreboot focuses on providing a fully free and open-source firmware replacement for these systems.

Libreboot primarily targets systems that use older x86 architectures and chipsets. Some of the supported architectures include:

1. Intel 32-bit (x86): Libreboot supports certain Intel processors and chipsets from the 32-bit era, such as those found in older ThinkPad laptops, desktop systems, and server boards.

2. AMD 64-bit (x86-64): Libreboot also supports select AMD 64-bit processors and chipsets from the pre-UEFI era, including systems like the ASUS KGPE-D16 server board.

It's important to note that Libreboot's support is limited to specific hardware platforms due to the project's emphasis on avoiding proprietary components and supporting fully free and open-source systems. Therefore, it may not have support for the latest x86 architectures or all mainstream x86-based systems.

Libreboot is a separate project from Coreboot, although it initially forked from an older version of Coreboot. While Coreboot supports a wider range of x86 systems, Libreboot focuses on providing a freedom-respecting firmware option for a subset of x86-based hardware platforms.
