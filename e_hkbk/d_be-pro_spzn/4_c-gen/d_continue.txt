The `continue` keyword is used in loops (such as `for` and `while` loops) to skip the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and move on to the next iteration. When the `continue` statement is encountered, the control flow jumps directly to the loop's update or increment section, bypassing the remaining statements in the loop for the current iteration.

Here's a basic example using a `for` loop:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Print even numbers between 1 and 10
    for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
        // Skip odd numbers
        if (i % 2 != 0) {
            continue;
        }

        // Print only even numbers
        printf("%d\n", i);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the loop iterates over the numbers from 1 to 10. The `if` statement checks whether the current number (`i`) is odd. If it's odd, the `continue` statement is executed, skipping the `printf` statement, and the loop proceeds to the next iteration. This results in only even numbers being printed.

The primary purpose of `continue` is to alter the flow of control within a loop based on a certain condition, allowing you to skip specific parts of the loop's body for certain cases. It's important to use `continue` judiciously, as overuse or misuse can lead to less readable code.
