Safety :
- ONLY PLUG IN THE SOLDERING IRON the moment you are ready two solder a pad with a lead.
- ALWAYS LEAVE IT IN THE SPRING HOLDER when not using it. 

Poor soldering instances :
- solder skip :
  - no actual solder connection between the PCB pad and the lead.
- solder bridge :
  - two or more pads become connected with excess solder.
