Kernel-mode activities :
| . accessing hardware devices and resources (I/O : disk , NIC , ...)
| . kernel-level memory management (paging swapping , virtmem)

"
The kernel can perform several activities that user processes cannot, including:

1. **Accessing Hardware Devices**: Directly interfacing with hardware components like disk drives, network interface cards (NICs), and other peripherals.
2. **Memory Management**: Allocating, freeing, and managing memory addresses, including page swapping and managing virtual memory.
3. **Process Management**: Creating, scheduling, and terminating processes, as well as managing process states and inter-process communication.
4. **Interrupt Handling**: Responding to hardware interrupts and managing context switches between processes.
5. **Direct Access to System Resources**: Accessing system resources like the CPU, timers, and I/O ports that user processes cannot interact with directly.
6. **File System Management**: Interacting with the file system for reading and writing files, including managing permissions and access controls.
7. **Implementing Security Policies**: Enforcing access controls, permissions, and security policies to protect system integrity.
8. **Handling System Calls**: Providing the interface for user processes to request services from the kernel through system calls.
9. **Managing Device Drivers**: Loading and managing device drivers that control hardware devices.
10. **Setting Up Networking**: Configuring and managing network protocols, sockets, and direct communication over the network.

These activities are critical for maintaining system stability, security, and performance, and are restricted to the kernel to prevent user processes from compromising the system.
