DIRECT MAPPING RECAP : 
==========================================================================================

In direct mapping , to rewrite one page :
 |
 |
 . buffer the block's content 
 . erase the block
 . amend the target page
 . load it back into the old block
 |
 |
 => more steps
 => few logical<-> physical address translations
 |
 |
 . one piece of data can take up an entire block 



==========================================================================================
BLOCK-BASED MAPPING : 
==========================================================================================

In block-level mapping , to rewrite one page :
 |
 |
 . shift the other pages to the freshest block
 . write the amended page to the new block 
 => fewer steps to page overwriting
 |
 |
 . multiple logical addresses can be mapped to the same block 
 => fewer steps in a logical <-> physical address translation
 |  . including in-block offsets
 |
 |
 . not suitable for small writes
