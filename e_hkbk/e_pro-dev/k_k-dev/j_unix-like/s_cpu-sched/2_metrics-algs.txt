Metrics :
. fairness - FIFO 
. performance - maximizing completion of tasks as quickly as possible, even at the expense of fairness  
. turnaround time
  = waiting time for this job + execution time for this job
  . reflects total wait , performance 
. response time
  = t(sched) - t(arrival)
  . reflects "quickness of appeasement" at the expense of smoothness , fairness 



Algorithms :
. FIFO (values fairness)
. SJF (values performance, allows for uninterrupted completion of tasks) 
. STCF (pre-emption of longer tasks to give way to shorter tasks)
. Round-robin (RR)
  . job 1 - x ms
  . job 2 - x ms
  . job 3 - x ms
  ...
  . job 1 - x ms
  . job 2 - x ms
  . job 3 - x ms
  ...
  ... until all jobs are completed. 
  . x = scheduling quantum based on the timer-interrupt
    . small enough to achieve most compact execution of all tasks (no overhead during the final quantum of a task)
    . large enough for consistent/complete context switching , thus keeping the scheduler responsive

=======================================================================================================================
===================================================== CONCLUSION : ====================================================
=======================================================================================================================

FIFO : 
. good for average turnaround time
  . minimal total wait per job
  . smooth execution 
. bad for average response time
  . jobs are not quickly "appeased"


RR : 
. good for average response time
  . jobs are quickly "appeased"  
. bad for average turnaround time 
  . total wait per job is not good 
  . execution of jobs is not smooth
