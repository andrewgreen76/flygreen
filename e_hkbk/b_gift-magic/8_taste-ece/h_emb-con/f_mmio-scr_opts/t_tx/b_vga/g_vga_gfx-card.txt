Yes, for direct manipulation of pixels on a PC screen, you typically need to go through the graphics card or integrated graphics processing unit (GPU). The graphics card is responsible for rendering images and managing the display on the screen.

Here's why a graphics card is essential:

1. **Display Interfaces:**
   - Graphics cards handle communication with the display through standard interfaces like HDMI, DisplayPort, or VGA. They convert digital signals from the computer into the visual information displayed on the screen.

2. **Framebuffer Management:**
   - The graphics card manages the framebuffer, which is the region of memory that represents the pixel data displayed on the screen. Directly manipulating pixels involves interacting with this framebuffer.

3. **Graphics Processing Unit (GPU):**
   - Graphics cards have specialized hardware (GPUs) designed for efficient graphics rendering. They are optimized for tasks related to 2D and 3D graphics.

4. **Driver Support:**
   - Graphics cards require drivers to communicate with the operating system and software applications. Directly manipulating pixels on the screen involves working within the framework provided by these drivers.

If your goal is to control pixels on a PC screen, you'll likely need to work with the existing graphics infrastructure. While a microcontroller can interact with the PC over communication interfaces (like USB or network protocols), the actual pixel manipulation and display control will still be handled by the graphics card.

If you have specific requirements or constraints for your project, providing more details could help in offering a more tailored solution or alternative approach.
