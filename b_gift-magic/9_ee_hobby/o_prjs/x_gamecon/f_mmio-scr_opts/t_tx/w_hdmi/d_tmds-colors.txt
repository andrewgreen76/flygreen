In the Transition-Minimized Differential Signaling (TMDS) interface used in HDMI, each TMDS channel is responsible for carrying specific information related to the color components and synchronization of the video signal. However, it's important to note that TMDS channels are not directly associated with individual colors like red, green, or blue, but rather with different aspects of the video signal.

In a typical HDMI connection, there are three TMDS channels: TMDS channel 0, TMDS channel 1, and TMDS channel 2. Here's a general overview of what each channel carries:

1. **TMDS Channel 0**: This channel carries pixel data for the red color component, as well as synchronization signals such as horizontal and vertical sync.

2. **TMDS Channel 1**: This channel carries pixel data for the green color component.

3. **TMDS Channel 2**: This channel carries pixel data for the blue color component.

Each TMDS channel carries 8 bits of data per clock cycle, resulting in a total of 24 bits per pixel (8 bits for red, 8 bits for green, and 8 bits for blue) in a standard HDMI signal. Additionally, there are also control and synchronization signals transmitted alongside the pixel data to ensure proper timing and synchronization of the video signal.

Therefore, while TMDS channel 0 does carry important synchronization signals, it primarily carries pixel data for the red color component ... . Each channel plays a crucial role in transmitting the complete video signal from the source device to the display device.
