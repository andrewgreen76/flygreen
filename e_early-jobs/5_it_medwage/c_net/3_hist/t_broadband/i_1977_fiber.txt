FIBER (OPTIC) CABLING
===================================================================================

 . uses light instead of electrical signals 
 . an electrical signal could reliably deliver data for thousands of feet before needing a repeater so as to
     avoid degradation   
 + fiber: greatest transmission range - dozens of miles before needing a repeater or an amplifier 
 + best Internet speeds

 . introduced in the 1970s
 . "with the first commercial fiber optic telephone system deployed by AT&T in 1977"
 . began to be used by telecom companies 
 . late 1990s - early 2000s: becomes the prevalent Internet cabling technology 
 - expensive to produce and plant 
 
 . for LAN demarcation: the Optical Network Terminator (ONT) instead of the modem 


Optical Network Terminator (ONT):
 . converts data for fiber-oriented protocol into data for the twisted-pair copper-oriented protocol
 . no delivery across copper cables is required
