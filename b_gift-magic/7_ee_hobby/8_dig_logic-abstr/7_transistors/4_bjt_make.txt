Doped silicon - chemically altered silicon (with a different molecular structure and electron cloud configurations). 

===================================================================================

"
The junctions in a BJT (Bipolar Junction Transistor) are made of silicon doped with boron (for p-type regions) and phosphorus (for n-type regions), forming the p-n junctions between the emitter, base, and collector, so the answer is a combination of (a) silicon and (b) boron and phosphorus.

"
Doping silicon with another element, such as boron or phosphorus, means intentionally adding impurities to the silicon crystal lattice to alter its electrical properties, creating p-type (boron) or n-type (phosphorus) regions that enable the formation of p-n junctions in devices like BJTs for controlling current flow.
