Electrical shunting is the process of diverting electrical current through an unintended low-resistance path, often bypassing the normal load or circuit, which can lead to inefficient operation or potential damage.

In electronics, a shunt is a precision resistor used to create a low-resistance path for current. By measuring the small voltage drop across the shunt, we can accurately calculate the current flowing in a circuit â€” a principle widely used in current sensing and monitoring systems.

ðŸ’¡ Key Features of Shunts:
 â€¢ Low resistance to minimize power loss
 â€¢ High accuracy for precise measurements
 â€¢ Wide current range options for different applications

ðŸ“¦ Where are they used?
 â€¢ Power supply monitoring
 â€¢ Battery management systems (BMS) in EVs
 â€¢ Solar energy systems
 â€¢ Industrial equipment control
 â€¢ DC power distribution panels

âš™ Example:
In a battery monitoring system, a shunt ensures that the current is measured with minimal impact on the overall system performance, enabling better efficiency and safety.

ðŸ”§ Popular Shunt Models:
 â€¢ Vishay: WSBS8518, WSL2512, WSL1206
 â€¢ IsabellenhÃ¼tte: BVN, BVR, SMR Series
 â€¢ Ohmite: FCSL Series, LVT Series
 â€¢ Yokogawa: 240A, 300A Shunts
