A power converter is an electrical device for converting electrical energy between alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC). It can also change the voltage or frequency of the current.

Actually, power converters are essential in manufacturing CPUs, as they regulate the voltage and current supplied to the various components of the processor, ensuring stable operation at the required power levels.
"


"
Power converters were introduced in CPU manufacturing in the **1980s**, as processors became more complex and required more precise voltage regulation to support increasing transistor counts and power consumption.
"


"
The first CPU model to feature a power converter was likely the **Intel 80486** (released in 1989), which required more sophisticated power management than its predecessors due to its higher clock speeds and greater complexity.

Instead of having a power supply unit generate some fixed voltage, the CPU uses a small set of digital signals, the VID lines, to instruct an on-board power converter of the desired voltage level. The switch-mode buck converter then adjusts its output accordingly.
