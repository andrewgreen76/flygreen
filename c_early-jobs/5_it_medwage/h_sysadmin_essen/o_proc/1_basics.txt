Application vs. image:
 |
 Q : "What does it mean for a process to run an image instead an application?"
 |
 A : "When a process runs an image instead of an application, it means it is executing a binary executable file
      (the program image) directly loaded into memory, rather than launching it through a higher-level wrapper
      or interface."


Daemon:
 . a background process, always out of sight and independent of the user
