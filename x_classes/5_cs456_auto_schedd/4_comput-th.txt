Theory of computation :
 . encompasses ...
    . computability theory
    . automata theory 
 . study of algorithms and automata 
 => study of determining machines and solutions
 => study of problem-solving machines 
 . Machine's capabilitiy : What can be computed with this machine ?


Computability theory :
 . the oblique , foundational side 
 . what can and what cannot be computed (algorithmically) 


Automata theory :
 . the clearer , more exciting side  
 . a study of "abstract machines and their computational capabilities"
 . ... abilities to follow patterns 


Humans are concerned with the imaginable. The machines are concerned with the doable.
