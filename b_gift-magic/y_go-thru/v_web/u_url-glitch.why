The error message you received indicates some issues related to the graphics library and environment settings. Here are a few things you can try to address the problem:

    Verify that you have the necessary dependencies and libraries installed for your graphics system. Ensure that the required packages for OpenGL and VA-API are properly installed.

    Check if you have any conflicting environment variables related to graphics configuration. The message "ATTENTION: default value of option mesa_glthread overridden by environment" suggests that there may be environment variables that are conflicting with the default configuration. You can unset or modify those environment variables to see if it resolves the issue.

    Update your graphics drivers to the latest version. Outdated or incompatible graphics drivers can cause problems with graphics libraries. Make sure you have the latest drivers installed for your graphics card.

    If you're running the script within a remote shell or over SSH, ensure that the X11 forwarding is properly set up and configured. X11 forwarding allows graphical applications to display on your local machine when running remotely.

    Consider using a different web browser or a headless browser library specifically designed for scripting purposes, such as Selenium or PhantomJS. These tools provide more reliable and predictable ways to interact with web content programmatically.

If the issue persists after trying these steps, it may require further investigation and troubleshooting specific to your system configuration and environment.
