Three ways of achieving things:
 |
 . The Jensen Huang way:
 |  . "I have plenty of time, I don't plan ahead."
 |
 . The Steve Jobs way:
 |  . "I don't have time. I will get things done today no matter what it takes."
 |  . That guy is exceptional because he sold his soul to the devil.
 |  . His whole life is a proof of concept for how far one person can go to achieve big things - to innovate,
 |    to earn revenue, etc.
 |
 . The third way:
    . Break out of the loop of bad habits, especially when it comes to finding and settling into a (better) job. 
    . 15-min meditations / doing absolutely nothing.
    . Negotiate with the noisy self - see a big change can do in your life, not a small change.
    . Seek ways to improve your life. You hate your job? Don't quit yet but do find a better job.
    . Find a community that will support you.
    . Focus on the things that bring you joy.
    . Mind the room for growth at your job or the desired job, mind the ceiling to your growth at those jobs.
    . If you have an impostor syndrome, ... get used to it.
    . Find a project to finish, a product or service that will prove to be useful to you. This will give you a
        direction. (Figure out a way to) work on the project that you would have faith in, something that would
	be immensely useful to everyone, yourself especially.
	=> You may come up with something that people will buy and this might even give you some pride points.
    . Find a community for moral support and discussion of things that resonate with you.
