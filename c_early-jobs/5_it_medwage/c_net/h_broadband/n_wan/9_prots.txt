WAN PROTOCOLS
===================================================================================

The packet switching protocol: 
 . a method of preventing data corruption
 -> a single message is split into multiple packets 
 -> these packets are triplicated
 -> every triplicate takes its own optimal route
 -> triplicates are collated and matched for error detection and correction ; at least two must match 
 -> the packets are reassembled 
 . otherwise, a retransmission request will be sent


Frame relay:
 |
 . old tech 
 . packet switching
 . between two WAN endpoints 
 . at the OSI model’s data-link and physical layers 
 . “used on Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) lines”
 . now used in places outside of WAN
 |
 . Frame relay network: 
   . a data communications network 
   . fast
   . graces packets in frames
   . reduces the need for error checking
   . writes the destination address into every frame 
   . Permanent Virtual Circuits (PVCs): for permanent connections 
   . Switched Virtual Circuits (SVCs): for temporary connections 


Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM): 
 . old tech 
 . encodes data with asynchronous time-division multiplexing 
 . encoded data is placed in fixed-size cells 
 . there are entire ATM networks 
 . replaced by IP 


High Level Data Control (HLDC):
 . data-link layer protocol 
 . error correction
 . flow control
 . polling for data transmission 
 . versatile due to use of multiple protocols 
 . supplanted Synchronous Data Link Control (SLDC) which uses only one 
 . modes: 
   . Asynchronous Response Mode (ARM): one-way permission to initiate a connection
   . Normal Response Mode (NRM): one-way permission to transmit data 
   . Asynchronous Balanced Mode (ABM): no need for permission to connect; two-way permission to transmit data


Packet over Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) or Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH): 
 . cover the terms of communicating over fiber cables 


Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS):
 . optimizing routing 
 . long addresses and short path labels would replace inefficient traditional table lookups
 . data is moved directly from node to node
