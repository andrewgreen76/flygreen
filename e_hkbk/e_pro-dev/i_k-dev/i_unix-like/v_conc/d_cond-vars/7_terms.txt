PRODUCER (THREAD) :
 . a thread that generates and populates data (in a buffer) 
====================================================================
CONSUMER (THREAD) :
 . a thread that uses data (and removes it from a buffer)
 . "... in a multi-threaded web server, a producer queues HTTP requests in a work queue (i.e., the bounded buffer). Consumer threads execute these requests."
====================================================================
BOUNDED BUFFER :
 . a fixed data structure shared between producers and consumers 
====================================================================

BOUNDED BUFFER in shell processing (piping) :
 |
 |
 . pipe {stdout , stdin}		// kernel's bounded buffer 
 |
 . --cmd1(){}-> [stdout]		// producer
   --pipe(){}-> [pipe]
   --xscallx{	pipe <- stdout  }->
   
   --cmd2(pipe){  ... pipe.stdin ...	// consumer 
		  ret ...
	       }
 
"When you pipe the output of one program into another, such as grep foo file.txt | wc -l, a bounded buffer is employed. This example runs two processes at the same time: grep writes lines from file.txt containing the string foo to standard output, and the UNIX shell redirects the output to a UNIX pipe (created by the pipe system call). The process wcâ€™s standard input is connected to the other end of this pipe, which simply counts the number of lines in the input stream and writes out the result. Thus, the grep process is the producer, and the wc process is the consumer, between them is an in-kernel constrained buffer, and you are simply the happy user in this example."

BOUNDED BUFFER PROBLEM : 
 . e.g., a producer says one thing , a consumer encounters something else

	signals true to CPU-schedr 					signaling thread passes over (ackns) to awoken thread 
	-> CPU-schedr takes time to decide which thread wakes 		-> awoken thread executes its critical section -> finishes 
	   	      	    	    	   	 			-> signaling thread reclaims control 

	thread wakes up -> rechecks condition -> may resume sleep  	 . (implicit wait : waking up and taking over) 
	 . (explicit wait)

	easier to implement

	ubiquitous in modern systems
