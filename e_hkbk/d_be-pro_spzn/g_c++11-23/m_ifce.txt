A class' collection of public member functions for interaction with other objects. 

==========================================================================================================================================
"
In C++, the term "class interface" typically refers to the set of public member functions and, optionally, public data members that define how objects of a class can be interacted with by the outside world. The class interface specifies the methods and properties that users of the class can use, and it encapsulates the implementation details within the class.

Here's an example to illustrate the concept of a class interface:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Class interface
class Calculator {
public:
    // Public member functions (methods)
    int add(int a, int b);
    int subtract(int a, int b);
    int multiply(int a, int b);
    double divide(int a, int b);

    // Public data member
    std::string description;

    // Constructor
    Calculator(std::string desc);

private:
    // Private member function
    int privateMethod(int a, int b);
};

// Implementation of the class interface
int Calculator::add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int Calculator::subtract(int a, int b) {
    return a - b;
}

int Calculator::multiply(int a, int b) {
    return a * b;
}

double Calculator::divide(int a, int b) {
    if (b != 0) {
        return static_cast<double>(a) / b;
    } else {
        std::cerr << "Error: Division by zero." << std::endl;
        return 0.0; // Handle the error gracefully
    }
}

Calculator::Calculator(std::string desc) : description(std::move(desc)) {
    // Constructor implementation
}

// Private member function (not part of the class interface)
int Calculator::privateMethod(int a, int b) {
    return a * b;
}

int main() {
    // Creating an object of the Calculator class
    Calculator myCalculator("Basic Calculator");

    // Using the public interface of the class
    std::cout << myCalculator.add(5, 3) << std::endl;
    std::cout << myCalculator.subtract(8, 2) << std::endl;
    std::cout << myCalculator.multiply(4, 6) << std::endl;
    std::cout << myCalculator.divide(9, 3) << std::endl;

    // Accessing the public data member
    std::cout << "Calculator description: " << myCalculator.description << std::endl;

    // The privateMethod is not accessible outside the class
    // myCalculator.privateMethod(2, 3); // This line would result in a compilation error

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `Calculator` class has a public interface consisting of four public member functions (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`) and one public data member (`description`). The constructor is also part of the public interface. The `privateMethod` is a private member function, and it is not accessible outside the class.

The main function demonstrates the usage of the class interface by creating an object of the `Calculator` class and using its public member functions and data members.
