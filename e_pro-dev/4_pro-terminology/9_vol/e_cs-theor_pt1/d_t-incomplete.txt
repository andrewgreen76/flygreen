Actually, there are many examples of Turing-incomplete machines, such as a digital watch that only tracks time, a basic thermostat, or a vending machine with a fixed set of operations. Each of these systems lacks the ability to simulate a Turing machine because they have limited functionality and do not support general-purpose computation.
