REMINDER :

Concurrency : multiple processes/threads running at the same time.

REMINDER :

CPU	 REGISTERS and CACHE in CPU are very fast but very small
RAM	 Fast but limited space
SSD	 Large but slow, contains file system
HDD	 Even larger, even slower 
============================================================================

Swap space :
. a portion of the disk used in the event of available memory capping out
. only unused pages are moved to the space
. in that respect, the swap space functions like an extension of RAM 


     -RAM-| -------- DISK -------- | 
     RAM <-> swap space <-> filesys


When a page is swapped out -> PAGE FAULT handling : 
-> its "present" bit is cleared 
-> the missing page is looked up
-> the kernel GENERATES A PAGE FAULT 
-> the kernel HANDLES THE PAGE FAULT : 
   . the kernel looks the page up by its swap space address (stored in a PT) and finds the page
   
   . an I/O request is issued		. the process is blocked

   . the kernel runs other processes on the CPU       . the page is swapped back into RAM
   
   . the I/O request is fulfilled
   . PT is updated (PTE.PFN is updated)
   . VPN -> PFN is retried
     . first retry : write in a PTE
     . second retry : write in a TLBE
