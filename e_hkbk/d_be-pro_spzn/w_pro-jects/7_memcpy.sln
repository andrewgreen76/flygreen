The `memcpy()` function is a widely used standard library function in C and C++ for memory copying. While it is not typically used directly for plotting pixels on the screen, it can be employed in various open-source projects as part of the underlying mechanisms for rendering or transferring pixel data.

Here are a few examples of open-source projects where `memcpy()` may be used in conjunction with other functions to facilitate pixel plotting or manipulation:

1. Framebuffer Libraries: Open-source framebuffer libraries like the Linux framebuffer API (`fbdev`) or DirectFB provide a direct interface for accessing the framebuffer device and performing pixel-level operations. `memcpy()` can be used to efficiently copy pixel data between memory buffers, allowing for fast pixel plotting or blitting operations.

2. Image Processing Libraries: Open-source image processing libraries such as OpenCV, FreeImage, or ImageMagick may use `memcpy()` as part of their internal routines for reading, writing, or manipulating image pixel data. These libraries often provide functions and utilities to handle pixel-level operations, and `memcpy()` can be utilized in these contexts for efficient memory copying.

3. Graphics Libraries: Graphics libraries like Cairo, SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer), or Allegro may involve `memcpy()` when working with pixel data. For example, when rendering to a software surface or manipulating pixel buffers, `memcpy()` can be used to efficiently copy pixel values between different regions of memory.

It's important to note that while `memcpy()` can be used in pixel plotting or manipulation scenarios, these open-source projects typically utilize various other techniques and optimizations specific to their respective goals and requirements.

The specific use of `memcpy()` and its role in pixel plotting or manipulation can vary across projects and codebases. Developers often employ `memcpy()` in combination with other functions and algorithms to achieve efficient pixel processing and rendering in their projects.
