How do I write a custom keybinding with the Alt button in a bash script?
ChatGPT

In Bash, you can create a custom keybinding with the Alt button using the bind built-in command. To define a keybinding with the Alt button, you need to use the escape sequence \e to represent the Alt key. Here's the syntax:

bash

bind -s 'keysequence':'command'

In the above syntax, keysequence represents the key combination with the Alt button, and command is the command or action you want to associate with that key combination.

For example, let's say you want to bind the key combination Alt+C to the command echo "Custom keybinding with Alt!". You can achieve this with the following command:

bash

bind -s '\ec':'echo "Custom keybinding with Alt!"'

After executing the bind command, whenever you press Alt+C in the Bash shell, the message "Custom keybinding with Alt!" will be printed.

To make this custom keybinding persistent across Bash sessions, you can add the bind command to your ~/.bashrc file. Here's an example:

bash

echo 'bind -s '\ec':'echo "Custom keybinding with Alt!"'' >> ~/.bashrc

After saving the ~/.bashrc file, either open a new terminal or run source ~/.bashrc to apply the changes to your current session.

Keep in mind that not all terminal emulators may handle the Alt key in the same way. Some may have different interpretations or may have the Alt key already bound to specific functions. Therefore, it's recommended to test your custom keybinding in your specific terminal emulator to ensure it works as expected.
