The Raspberry Pi is a series of single-board computers that are primarily designed to promote learning about computing and programming. While the Raspberry Pi Foundation, which develops and manufactures Raspberry Pi boards, promotes open-source software and encourages community involvement, the hardware design of Raspberry Pi boards is not fully open-source. The foundation has released the schematics and some technical documentation for the boards, allowing for community collaboration and modification, but some components and details of the board design are proprietary.

It's worth noting that the Raspberry Pi runs on various open-source operating systems, such as Linux distributions, and supports a wide range of open-source software. The Raspberry Pi Foundation actively contributes to open-source projects and supports the open-source community.
