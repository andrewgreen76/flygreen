The Motorola 68020 microprocessor was introduced in 1984. It was part of the Motorola 68000 series of microprocessors and served as the successor to the Motorola 68010. The 68020 featured several enhancements over its predecessor, including a 32-bit external data bus, improved addressing modes, and support for virtual memory. It also introduced a built-in memory management unit (MMU), which facilitated the implementation of operating systems with memory protection and multitasking capabilities. The 68020 found use in a variety of computing devices, including personal computers, workstations, and embedded systems, and it was a popular choice for Unix-based systems.

The Motorola 68020 microprocessor was used in several personal computer models during the 1980s and early 1990s. Here are some notable examples:

1. **Commodore Amiga 3000:** The Commodore Amiga 3000, introduced in 1990, featured the Motorola 68020 CPU. It was a high-end model in the Amiga series and offered improved performance and expandability compared to earlier models.

2. **Sun Microsystems SPARCstation 1:** The Sun SPARCstation 1, introduced by Sun Microsystems in 1989, used the Motorola 68020 CPU as part of its Sun-4 architecture. It was a Unix-based workstation used in engineering, scientific, and research applications.

3. **Atari TT030:** The Atari TT030, introduced in 1990, used the Motorola 68030 CPU, but some models were equipped with the Motorola 68020 CPU. It was a high-end workstation-class computer designed for professional users.

4. **NeXTcube and NeXTstation:** The NeXTcube and NeXTstation computers, introduced by NeXT Computer in the late 1980s, used the Motorola 68030 CPU. However, some early models were equipped with the Motorola 68020 CPU before the transition to the 68030.

5. **Apollo/Domain:** Some models in the Apollo/Domain series of workstations, introduced by Apollo Computer in the mid-1980s, used the Motorola 68020 CPU. These workstations were primarily used in engineering, scientific, and research applications.

These are just a few examples of personal computer models that featured the Motorola 68020 microprocessor. The 68020 offered improved performance and capabilities over its predecessor, the 68010, and found use in various computing devices during its time.
