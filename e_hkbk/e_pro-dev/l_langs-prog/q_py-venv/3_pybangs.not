Both `#!/usr/bin/env python` and `#!/usr/bin/env python3` are shebang lines commonly used at the beginning of a Python script to specify the interpreter that should be used to execute the script. However, there is an important difference between them:

1. `#!/usr/bin/env python`:
   - This shebang line indicates that the script should be executed using the `python` interpreter found in the user's `PATH`.
   - It may point to either Python 2.x or Python 3.x, depending on how the `python` command is configured in the system.
   - If the default `python` command points to Python 2.x, the script will be executed using Python 2.x. If it points to Python 3.x, the script will be executed using Python 3.x.

2. `#!/usr/bin/env python3`:
   - This shebang line explicitly specifies that the script should be executed using the `python3` interpreter found in the user's `PATH`.
   - It ensures that the script is executed with Python 3.x, regardless of whether the default `python` command points to Python 2.x or Python 3.x.

Using `#!/usr/bin/env python3` is considered a best practice when writing Python scripts, especially when targeting Python 3.x. It provides greater clarity and ensures that the script is executed with the intended version of Python.

In summary, if you want to explicitly use Python 3.x, it's recommended to use `#!/usr/bin/env python3` in your shebang line to ensure consistent behavior across different environments.
