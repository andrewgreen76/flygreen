In this D-latch -based flip-flop the clock replaces the enable input. The use of the clock allows for automation of the enable (i.e., we don't have to enable manually). 



SUMMARY : the following latches can be thought of as simply attempts at solving the unlatching problem. 
|
- SR-latch : captures and loses electrical signal on command with two keys (the set key and the reset key)
  - solves : latching a data bit is possible 
  - problem : you are doing this with two keys instead of one
|  
- a basic latch with one input - the data bit : captures signal with a press of a single key, loses signal with a release of that key. 
  - players : in key 
  - solves : works great for modifier key functionality ; doing away with S and R we guarantee circuit stability.  
  - problem : no latching at key release 
  - (Tip : use an inverter to implement this. ;-) )
|
- SR-latch with the enable pin : in-out registry at EN high.
  - players : S, R, EN
  - solves : latching is possible (with EN high) 
  - problem : we are back to S and R, and now we depend on EN.    
  - (the enable pin is otherwise known as the load)
|
- D-latch (based on SR with EN, but with one input key) : captures signal at key press and loses it at key release at EN high.
  - players : EN, in key 
  - solves : we can toggle a functionality/feature with smth like a keybinding (manual EN) or have a single-key toggle (EN always high) 
  - problem : output high is "easy to lose" ; the output high is only as long as the input high (at EN high) - no latching at key release  
|
- clock - used for : 
  - automated/regulated drive of input (or any data for that matter)
    - binary data is "listened to", captured at clock peaks, stored, and then sequentially processed 
  - "chewing food" , experiencing/savoring dynamics
  - regulation of processing and storing data in stages , capturing intermediate outputs  
    - automated handling of stages (booting up a computer)
  - automated flipping through multiple stages marked by captured/lost signals within memory circuits (where every bit/line is in a state 0 or 1) 
  - waiting for something , "sensitivity" to change 
  - automated counting/idling
  - a slower, regulated change of output (clocking/counting, display/animation)
  - automated anything
  - regulation helps make conditioning and sequencing (and ergo, debugging) possible
  - once added to a D latch, it will automate the latch's behavior of listening to the input at every clock cycle. 
|
- a rising-edge detector : BRIEFLY lets clock/enable high through at equal time intervals.
  - No other moment makes an impact on the output of the flip-flop, the larger circuit.
  - solves : allows the flip-flop to put out/retain the same output just for this one clock cycle of X number of clock cycles.  
  - problem : only achieves suspended latching 
|
- D flip-flop : uses a clocked rising-edge detector as the governing signal for input capturing.
  - The detector BRIEFLY lets clock/enable high through, marking the moment when the input value is to be reflected on the output.
  - Other than the start of clock peak, no other moment makes an impact on the output, and so THE INPUT IS CAPTURED FOR LONG ENOUGH TIME
    for it to be processed or stored (during one or more cycles). This allows for a controlled sequence of events. 
  - Output reflects the input every [clock cycle length] milliseconds.
  - We assume the clock cycles to be long enough to give every bit of data enough time to cross the voltage threshold for 1
    or the voltage threshold for 0. 
  - We assume the clock cycles to be short enough to capture, not miss, every fed-in 0 and 1 at a time.
  - We assume that the feeding of input words is one word of data at a time. 
  - We assume that the storage of words of data is carefully orchestrated so that every word is neither missed nor duplicated.
  |
  - The load bit - the clocked enable - peaks at the clock rate, briefly selecting the input data channel over the "old" output.
    (Yes, this way the flip-flop functions as a multiplexer.) 
  - solves : an array of flip-flops puts out/retains the same output just for this one clock cycle or X number of clock cycles,
    be that for processing or future use. Employing the right technique can help us command the flip-flops to store the same data
    indefinitely. 
  - problem : using an array of flip-flops incorrectly can only help us achieve undesirably brief latching
  |
  In an attempt to make everything clear :
  - What we have here is essentially a circuit that works like a latching/looping multiplexer with a pulsating select.
    The clocked enable briefly selects the input data channel over the "old" output. The output will flip only when a different
    data bit is fed in as the input at the peak of the clocked enable. 



Further clarification :
- SR latches - pros :
  - [unclear]
- SR latches - cons : 
  - SR latches are STATIC circuits, where automated dynamic data processing is not possible.
- D flip-flops - pros : 
  - By comparison, D flip-flops HAVE A CLOCK. Clock cycles allow for "breaking up" the flow of
    multi-bit bus data down the line ; words of data are captured at every cycle or X number of cycles ;
    incremental programmed/scripted processing of data is possible. 
- D flip-flops - cons :
  - [unclear]
- One bit of data may not mean anything, but it's the configuration of bits that has a meaning to it for sure.
