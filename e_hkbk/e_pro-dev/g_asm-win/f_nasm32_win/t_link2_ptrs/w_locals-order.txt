The integer is at `esp+24` and the pointer at `esp+28` because the stack grows downwards, and the convention typically places local variables at lower addresses (closer to `esp`) and their pointers or references at higher addresses. This arrangement helps maintain a clear structure: the value (`a`) is stored first, followed by the pointer (`p`) to that value, allowing for easier access and organization as the stack grows.

Q : This makes no sense. The pointer is a local variable.

You're correct that both the integer and the pointer are local variables. The reason for placing the integer at `esp+24` and the pointer at `esp+28` likely comes down to the order in which the compiler decided to allocate stack space for these variables.

### Explanation:
1. **Variable Layout**: The compiler often places variables in a specific order based on how they're declared or used. In this case, it chose to allocate the integer first at `esp+24` and then the pointer at `esp+28`.

2. **Access Patterns**: By storing the integer first, it can be accessed directly without needing to calculate offsets from the pointer's location. This can be beneficial for access patterns in certain scenarios.

3. **Alignment**: The compiler might also consider alignment and padding when allocating stack space for variables, which could influence the order.

Ultimately, both variables are local, but their specific order in memory is determined by the compiler's optimization strategies and conventions.
