When swapping a page into a capped-out RAM , a page replacement policy must be deployed. 
. "The page-replacement policy is the process of deciding which pages should be removed or replaced." 
. Ideally, in a situation like this, we would have used precaution to retain a little chunk of RAM free to keep process service flowing.
. We need some kind of an in-RAM page eviction policy to retain that free memory.

When the total number of pages has exceeded something called the the HIGH WATERMARK (HW) -or-
there are no free pages available in the memory : 
. the swapping thread goes to sleep
. a swap daemon ("swapd" , a.k.a. page daemon) wakes up and starts kicking pages out of the memory
. once the number of pages plummetted passed the LOW WATERMARK (LW) , the swap daemon stops and sleeps
. the swapping thread resumes work 
  . technically , a daemon responds to special circumstances , while a policy is a persistently exercised rule 



There are other ideas for optimization of memory relief :
. grouping pages and moving them to a SWAP PARTITION
. the idea is to make disk I/O efficient
  . reducing on-disk seek overhead and rotational overhead
