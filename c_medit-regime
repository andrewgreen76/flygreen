Basic understanding of and observations on meditation:

Meditation is basically the opposite of spending even relatively
long periods of time deep in the thought-space. When you are listening
(not hearing, but listening) to something or someone, watching
a movie, or feeling the traction of the road you are walking on,
you are mindful of an element of your surroundings. That's meditation.
