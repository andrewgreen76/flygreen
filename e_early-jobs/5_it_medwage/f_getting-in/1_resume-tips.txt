YOUR RESUME 
===================================================================================

Resume basics : 
 . include your up-to-date resume - on LinkedIn , etc.
 . your resume must REFLECT THE SAME BULLET POINTS AS THOSE IN THE JD
 . your resume must REFLECT ONLY THE THINGS THAT ARE RELEVANT to the position
    ... or as many relevant things as possible
    . as much of relevant work as possible , but don't skip recent jobs
    . show relevant skills (". Attention to detail" , ". Fast learner" , etc.) 
 . look up the standard resume template
 . have somebody give feedback on your resume
 . Sell it to the recruiter that you are the right match for the position , not that you are looking
     for work in any desired (e.g., technical) capacity or that you are just looking for a job. It’s
     how you look your most professional.
 . DON’T TARGET THE SPECIFIC FIELD ; TARGET THE ROLE. 


Other things :
 . don't forget to follow the templates/formats included in this directory
 . include all the certificates - and maybe trim off all the irrelevant ones
 . IT IS OK to highlight your skills more than your work experience
 . There is a format for that - "functional"/"skill-based" - and it can reflect your fit , so you may
     have to follow that format.
 . With Google (IT) : RELEVANT EXPERIENCE AND SKILLS > general work experience 


Formats :
 . Contact the company’s HR and ask them what resume format they want to see - since not all companies
     are alike and they do not necessarily endorse the same resume format.
 . Skill-based : 
   - a brief summary of qualifications 
   - reflect the value of every skill with quantifiable impact you made using it 
   - only list tools and topics you actually know a fair deal about ; don’t list everything you have a marginal experience with 
   Relevant work -oriented : 
   - action + noun + quantified achievement 
   - don’t pad the role you worked in with bullet points about minutia ; reflect your relevant strengths
