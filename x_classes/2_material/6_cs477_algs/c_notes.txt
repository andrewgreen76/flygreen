    + the analytical engine
      + ALU (comparisons , square-roots )
      + control (branching , loops) , memory
    . Concern - speed.

Why capitalize on Big-O ?

O , omega , theta - used for comparing two functions as they scale.
 . theta - asymptotic equality

Logarithms :
 . ...

Questions :
 . n0 - ? 
 . c - ?
??? Functions as sets of functions :
 . What does it mean for one function to be a set of another function ?

Formal definition of omega - ?
 . contradiction - ? 

n - size of input

Prove for : from n0 to inf.

constraining - ?

theta proves both O and omega.
