Wayland and X11 (also known as the X Window System) are two different display server protocols that serve as the foundation for graphical display and input handling in Linux and Unix-like operating systems. Here are the key differences between Wayland and X11:

    Architecture: Wayland has a simpler and more modern architecture compared to X11. Wayland follows a "compositor" model where the display server directly manages the rendering of windows and handles input events. In contrast, X11 follows a client-server model, where an X server handles the rendering and input, and client applications communicate with the server to display their windows.

    Performance and Efficiency: Wayland is designed to be more efficient and provide better performance than X11. Wayland reduces overhead by eliminating unnecessary layers and minimizing context switches between applications and the display server. This results in improved responsiveness, reduced latency, and smoother graphics.

    Security: Wayland offers enhanced security compared to X11. Wayland isolates client applications from each other, preventing one application from directly accessing or affecting the rendering of another application's windows. This isolation helps mitigate security vulnerabilities and improves overall system security.

    Window Management: Wayland provides built-in window management functionality, including window resizing, moving, and stacking. In X11, window management is typically handled by a separate window manager, which may introduce inconsistencies in behavior across different window managers.

    Compatibility: X11 has been around for several decades and has a vast ecosystem of applications and toolkits built on top of it. As a result, X11 enjoys better compatibility with legacy software and may offer better support for certain use cases, such as complex multi-monitor setups, remote desktop access, or niche applications that rely on X11-specific features.

    Adoption: Wayland has gained increasing adoption in recent years and is becoming the standard display server protocol for many Linux distributions and desktop environments. However, X11 still remains widely used and is the default display server in many Linux distributions, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of software.

It's worth noting that while Wayland offers many advantages, there may still be cases where X11 is preferred, especially for specific applications or environments with unique requirements.
