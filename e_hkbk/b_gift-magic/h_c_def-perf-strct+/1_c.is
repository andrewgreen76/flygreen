C is a programming language 
- typically used to create the building blocks for entire systems capable of self-hosting and/or interfacing with the user. 
- but you can use it to create anything you wish (like videogames).
- Your PROGRAMMING STYLE will invariably determine the PERFORMANCE of the device running your program.
- In other words, C is not only a language used for creativity and system build; it is also a language for writing code that will determine the performance of the system running that code.
