As an AI language model, I don't have specific knowledge of the memory management implementation of a Dell Inspiron 14 laptop or any specific hardware. However, I can provide some general information on memory leaks and how they are typically handled in C programming.

In C, memory management is typically done manually using functions like malloc() and free(). If you allocate memory using malloc() but fail to release it with free() when it is no longer needed, it can result in a memory leak. Memory leaks occur when allocated memory is not properly deallocated, leading to a loss of available memory over time.

Memory leaks are typically handled by ensuring that memory is properly deallocated when it is no longer needed. This involves identifying the parts of the code where memory is allocated and making sure that the corresponding deallocation calls are present. Proper memory management practices, such as tracking allocated memory and freeing it appropriately, can help prevent memory leaks.

In the case of a Dell Inspiron 14 or any other computer, the operating system is responsible for managing memory and reclaiming resources when a program terminates. This includes freeing any memory that was allocated by the program, whether it has been properly deallocated or not. However, relying on the operating system to clean up memory leaks is not a recommended practice, as it can lead to inefficient memory usage and potential performance issues.

It's important for developers to be mindful of memory management in their C programs and ensure that they follow best practices to avoid memory leaks. This includes properly allocating and freeing memory, tracking allocated memory, and handling error conditions related to memory allocation. Tools like memory profilers and debugging tools can also help detect and diagnose memory leaks during development and testing.
