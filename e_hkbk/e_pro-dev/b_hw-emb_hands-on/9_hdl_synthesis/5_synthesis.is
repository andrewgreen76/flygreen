Sure, here's an example of synthesis in the context of hardware description languages (HDLs) like Verilog:

Let's say you want to design a simple digital circuit that adds two 4-bit binary numbers and outputs the result. You might describe the behavior of this circuit in a high-level HDL like Verilog using a structural design approach. Here's what the Verilog code might look like:

```verilog
module Adder(input [3:0] A, input [3:0] B, output [4:0] Sum);
    wire [3:0] Carry;
    wire [3:0] AddResult;

    // Implement the adder logic
    Adder4Bit adder_inst(.A(A), .B(B), .Cin(Carry), .S(AddResult), .Cout(Carry));

    // Add the carry-out bit to the sum
    assign Sum[3:0] = AddResult;
    assign Sum[4] = Carry[3];
endmodule
```

In this example, the Verilog code describes a 4-bit adder module that takes two 4-bit inputs `A` and `B` and produces a 5-bit sum `Sum`. The `Adder4Bit` module is instantiated to perform the actual addition operation, and the carry-out bit is added to the most significant bit of the sum.

However, this high-level Verilog code is not directly executable on hardware. It needs to be synthesized into lower-level gate-level descriptions that can be used to program FPGA or ASIC devices. The synthesis tool takes this Verilog code and automatically transforms it into gate-level logic that implements the desired behavior of the circuit.

The synthesis process involves mapping the high-level Verilog constructs to the specific resources available in the target FPGA or ASIC device, optimizing the design for area, speed, or power consumption, and generating a bitstream that can be loaded onto the hardware to configure it to perform the desired operation.

In this way, synthesis transforms the abstract high-level description of a digital circuit into the concrete implementation that can be realized on a specific hardware platform.
