================ ROADMAPS AND RECIPES - PROJECT-DEPENDENT ================ 


PCB - DESIGN 
   . tools 
   . circuit design : architecture / instr.set , decoder logic , ALU , control unit 
   . circuit prototyping : online simulation 
   . [PCB's 3D/physical design] x [actual hardware] : PCB layers
  (a) easy projects : embedded PCBs , (backplane) , power supply , blinkenboard } ] x [architecture: x86 , RISC-V] x [layers: single-layer, 4-12-16 layers] 
  (b) hard projects : SSD , GPU , motherboard					} ] 														 


PCB - FABRICATION (TOOLS , MACHINES , MATERIALS) - [Let them do the fab'ing. ... and/or study it. ] 
 . 


IC - DESIGN 
 . tools 
 . circuit design : architecture / instr.set , decoder logic , ALU , control unit 
 . circuit prototyping : online simulation 
 . [IC's 3D/physical design] x [actual hardware] : 
 . logic families 		CMOS , (TTL) 				[need visuals, explain differences]
 . packaging 			QFP , SOIC , QFN , BGA ; (P)DIP , SMD 	[need visuals, explain differences]
 . integrated circuits		(a) microcontrollers (PIC12LF1840) ; (b) CPU + ROM + RAM

FW (programming) 
 . 


OS
 . embsys OS : microkernel ? , target architecture - ?
 . bootloader
 . kernel 
 . PC OS : monolithic , x86 , target architecture - ?


CC
 . concept of subset : can we do system calls ? can we write libraries ? 
 . convert directly to assembly , directly to object file , or directly to binary executable ? 
 . target architecture - agnostic 
 . methods for compilerâ€™s installation (installer , manual installation)


Game
 . anything you want ... on your machine
