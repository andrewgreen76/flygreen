KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) primarily supports hardware virtualization. KVM leverages hardware virtualization extensions, such as Intel VT-x or AMD-V, to enable efficient virtualization of the CPU. This allows guest operating systems to run with near-native performance.

While KVM's default mode is hardware virtualization, it also supports paravirtualization to some extent. Through the use of paravirtualized drivers and the VirtIO framework, KVM can enhance performance for certain I/O operations by allowing guest operating systems to communicate directly with the underlying virtualization layer. However, the guest OS must be modified to support paravirtualization for this to work effectively.

KVM does not directly support software virtualization, as software virtualization techniques are typically slower and less efficient compared to hardware-based virtualization methods. The primary focus of KVM is on utilizing hardware virtualization features to provide a high-performance virtualization environment for running multiple guest operating systems on a Linux host.
