A TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) is a specialized hardware accelerator designed by Google specifically for machine learning workloads. TPUs are tailored to perform matrix operations efficiently, which are fundamental to many deep learning algorithms. TPUs are highly optimized for parallel processing and can deliver significantly higher performance and energy efficiency compared to traditional CPUs or GPUs for machine learning tasks.

TPUs are typically used in large-scale data centers to accelerate machine learning models, enabling faster training and inference times. They are commonly employed in various applications such as natural language processing, image recognition, recommendation systems, and more.

Google has developed multiple generations of TPUs, with each iteration offering improved performance and capabilities. TPUs are not generally available for consumer purchase, but Google Cloud provides access to TPUs through its cloud computing services, allowing users to harness the power of TPUs for their machine learning workloads.
