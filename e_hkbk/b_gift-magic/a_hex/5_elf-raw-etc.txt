ELF VS. RAW BINARY : 
========================================================================================

raw binary - "a sequence of bytes WITHOUT ANY ACCOMPANYING HEADERS OR METADATA (to define its structure or execution context)."
ELF binary   - structured WITH HEADERS AND TABLES

There are other types of binary files , so think about what their contents would look like.
Are they structured ? Do they have headers (with metadata) and/or tables ? Unique magic numbers ?

No, not all binary files are ELFs (Executable and Linkable Format). Binary files can be in various formats, depending on their purpose and how they are created. Here's a quick overview of different types of binary files:

### 1. **ELF (Executable and Linkable Format)**
   - **Usage**: Commonly used for executable files, object code, shared libraries, and core dumps on Unix-like systems (e.g., Linux).
   - **Features**: Contains headers that describe the file's layout and how it should be executed or linked.

### 2. **PE (Portable Executable)**
   - **Usage**: The standard format for executable files, object code, and DLLs on Windows systems.
   - **Features**: Contains headers and sections similar to ELF but specific to the Windows operating system.

### 3. **Raw Binary Files**
   - **Usage**: Files that contain raw machine code or data without any file headers or metadata. Often used for low-level programming, firmware, or as a part of a bootloader.
   - **Features**: No metadata or headers; just a sequence of bytes.

### 4. **COFF (Common Object File Format)**
   - **Usage**: An older format used for object files on various platforms, including early versions of Unix and some Microsoft systems.
   - **Features**: Contains headers and sections similar to ELF but in a different format.

### 5. **Mach-O (Mach Object)**
   - **Usage**: The standard binary format used by macOS and iOS for executables, object code, and shared libraries.
   - **Features**: Contains headers and sections specific to Apple's operating systems.

### 6. **Other Formats**
   - **Hexadecimal Files**: Files with hexadecimal representations of data, often used for programming EEPROMs or other firmware.
   - **S-records**: Text-based formats for representing binary data, used in embedded systems.

### Summary

- **ELF**: A specific format for Unix-like systems, used for executables and libraries.
- **PE, COFF, Mach-O**: Other executable formats for different operating systems.
- **Raw Binary**: Simple files with no headers or metadata, often used in low-level programming.

Different types of binary files serve different purposes and are used in different contexts, depending on the operating system and application requirements.
