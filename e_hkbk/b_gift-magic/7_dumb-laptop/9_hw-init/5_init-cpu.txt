CPU INITIALIZATION :

 . "... CPU initialization typically spans multiple clock cycles as various hardware
    components are configured and initialized during the system startup process."
    
 . the fetch operation is a microcode decoded into control signals that trigger a certain
   address in ROM ; the ROM then outputs the data at that address into the program counter
   
 . "... typically, the fetch operation, including microcode decoding, ROM access, and
    loading the reset vector into the program counter, occurs within a single clock cycle
    of the CPU."

 . "A CPU's internal logic is designed to automatically initiate certain operations,
    such as fetching the reset vector, upon power-on, enabling it to execute initial
    firmware routines without requiring explicit instructions from external sources."

 . "Address generation circuits within the CPU are responsible for generating the address bits
    used to access ROM during operations like fetching the reset vector."

 . "Address generation circuits in a CPU typically include counters, multiplexers, and
    other logic elements that generate memory addresses based on control signals and
    internal states. These circuits are designed to produce the necessary address bits
    required to access specific locations within the ROM chip, such as the one containing
    the reset vector. The generation of address bits is often orchestrated by control signals
    derived from the CPU's instruction decoding and execution mechanisms, ensuring precise
    memory access during operations like fetching instructions or data from ROM."

 . "The [multiple-address] indirection allows for flexibility and adaptability in CPU design,
    facilitating the execution of various initialization routines and accommodating potential
    modifications or optimizations to the boot process without requiring changes to the core
    instruction execution mechanism, such as the program counter initialization."

 . "In some CPU architectures, fetching the reset vector from ROM may indeed occur within
    a single clock cycle, but in others, it may span multiple clock cycles depending on
    the specific implementation and design of the CPU."

========================================================================================
MEMORY ADDRESS ASSIGNMENT : 
========================================================================================

 . "Memory address assignment occurs through a process of memory mapping, where specific
    ranges of addresses are allocated to different hardware components either statically
    through hardware design or dynamically by the system firmware during initialization,
    ensuring coherent and organized access to each component within the system's address
    space."

All registers are cleared. Then , ... reset vector : 

0x0000fff0	 ; IP (fetch instr @ resv) 
0x0000f000	 ; CS selector
0xffff0000	 ; CS base


CS base    + IP         = resv
0xffff0000 + 0x0000fff0 = 0xfffffff0

A CPU can be initialized without executing any code by configuring its internal registers and control units through hardware-based mechanisms such as power-on reset signals or configuration pins, ensuring basic functionality and readiness for code execution.
