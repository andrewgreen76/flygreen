Parity :
 . a method of enforcing data integrity across RAID


Parity bits :
 . used in error detection 
 . parity bits accompany corresponding data 
    . error-checking : comparing parity bits 
 . may need a parity disk 

================================================================================
 . ONES = sum of 1's 
 . EVEN_SUM = even number of 1's 
 . ODD_SUM = odd number of 1's   
================================================================================
Odd parity arrangement :

 . (ONES + [parity_bit] ) = ODD_SUM 

   1011001 1     =>	1 = parity bit 

   1101011 0     =>	0 = parity bit
================================================================================
Even parity arrangement :
  
 . (ONES + [parity_bit] ) = EVEN_SUM	

   1101011 1     =>	1 = parity bit

   1110001 0 	 =>	0 = parity bit
================================================================================
Parity checks :
 . error-checking
 . fault tolerance
 . reconstruction after disk failure 

 . stored parity 	<- a bit representing even parity or odd parity 
 . calculated parity 	<- from the RAID controller or the host's CPU
    . if calculated parity bit does not match the stored parity bit , we have an error(s) 
 . single-bit parity fails with an even number of errors
