THE BRASS TACKS - USING CHECKSUMS : 
========================================================================================

A client

  |
  = FS
  = storage controller
  = etc.
  |
  |
  . lifts a data block from the server
  . lifts the corresp. stored checksum from the server
  -> computes another checksum locally
  -> matches the checksums to ensure data integrity
  |
  |
  (a) all is good ; make it available to the user
  (b) data is corrupted ; deploy a copy of the data block from the redundant (twin) disk instead
     . no copy => tough luck ! Should have known better.
