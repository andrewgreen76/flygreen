Actually the imaginary unit i is used heavily in dozens of practical engineering & physics domains — most notably electrical engineering (AC circuit analysis, impedance, signal processing), quantum mechanics, control theory, signal & image processing (Fourier transforms), electromagnetism, fluid dynamics, and many branches of modern signal-processing-based technologies (radar, MRI, audio, telecommunications, etc.).(So the assumption unfortunately goes the opposite way: today it is hard to find a sophisticated technical domain that doesn't make routine, production use of complex numbers.)

The imaginary unit i (defined as the square root of −1) emerged in the mid-16th century when Italian mathematicians like Girolamo Cardano (in his 1545 book Ars Magna) and especially Rafael Bombelli (in his 1572 Algebra) encountered

															  of negative numbers while solving cubic equations using radical formulas, leading them to manipulate these "fictitious" quantities formally to obtain correct real-number solutions despite initial skepticism and the derogatory label "imaginary" later coined by René Descartes.
