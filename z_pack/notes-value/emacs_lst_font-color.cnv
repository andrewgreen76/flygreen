Would you happen to know how Emacs Classic in Bash decides on font coloring in files with extension .lst?
ChatGPT

In Emacs Classic, the font coloring for files with the extension .lst is determined by the major mode associated with that file type. Each major mode in Emacs has its own rules for font coloring and highlighting.

The specific font coloring rules for .lst files will depend on the major mode being used. The major mode is determined based on the file's content or its specific file association configuration in Emacs.

To determine which major mode is being used for .lst files in Emacs Classic, you can check the value of the variable major-mode while visiting a .lst file. You can do this by opening a .lst file in Emacs Classic and then executing the following command:

sql

M-x describe-variable RET major-mode RET

This command will display the value of major-mode in the minibuffer. It will indicate the specific major mode being used for .lst files, such as fundamental-mode, text-mode, or a custom mode.

Once you know the major mode, you can explore the associated Emacs Lisp code or configuration to determine how font coloring is implemented for .lst files in that mode. The specific font coloring rules can vary depending on the major mode and the configuration settings or customizations made by the user.
