Writing Verilog code to simulate the digital circuits in order to verify the correctness of their behavior. Then,
  a virtual form of the chip is created.

===================================================================================
BUILD - DIGITAL DESIGN
===================================================================================

1. Simulation:
 (a) functional design/verification, a.k.a. behavioral modeling
 (b) RTL design
  . Create digital circuits to implement the chip's functionality
  . Write HDL (Hardware Description Language) code to describe the digital circuits
  . Simulate the digital circuits to verify their correctness
  . Logic design is the process of creating the digital circuitry (using gates, flip-flops, and combinational/
      /sequential elements) that implements the functional behavior, typically expressed in RTL as part of front-
      -end digital design.
  . Tools used :
     . for HDL (Verilog ;-) ) editing : Vim, Emacs, VS Code, Synopsys Verdi, Cadence Incisive Desktop
     . for performing simulation based on the HDL code : ModelSim, Questa


2. Synthesis:
 . produces a gate-level netlist
 |
 . before physical design
 . takes and converts RTL code into a gate-level netlist
 . the netlist is to be used in the layout implementation stage ("virtualizing" the chip)
 . Tools used : Synopsys Design Compiler, Cadence Genus


Debugging occurs during both simulation and synthesis.
 . Tools used : Verdi, DVE


Other tools :
 . Icarus Verilog can do both sim and synthesis
 . Verilator converts the HDL code into models prior to simulation
