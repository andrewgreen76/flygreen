Control Register 3 (CR3) is a special-purpose register in the x86 architecture that is used to store the physical base address of the page directory table. It was introduced with the Intel 80386 processor (386), which was released in 1985.

CR3 is a 32-bit register that holds the base address of the page directory table (PDT) in physical memory. The page directory table is a data structure used by the processor's memory management unit (MMU) to translate virtual addresses to physical addresses when paging is enabled. The contents of the page directory table determine how virtual addresses are mapped to physical addresses, allowing for the implementation of virtual memory.

When the processor performs a memory access, it uses the page directory table specified in CR3 to perform the address translation. By storing the base address of the page directory table in CR3, the processor ensures that the correct translation table is used for address translation.

CR3 is a critical component of the x86 architecture's memory management mechanism, enabling the implementation of virtual memory and providing the foundation for memory protection, multitasking, and other advanced memory management features.

In summary, CR3 is used to store the physical base address of the page directory table in x86 processors. It was introduced with the Intel 80386 processor and plays a crucial role in memory management and address translation in the x86 architecture.
