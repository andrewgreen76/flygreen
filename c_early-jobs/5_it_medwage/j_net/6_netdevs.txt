Network stack : "hardware and software that makes up the [networking] infrastructure for a computer". 


===================================================================================
DEVICES INVOLVED IN NETWORKS 
===================================================================================

Servers :
 . a device or process that provides a service
 . enterprise-grade servers are big hunks of metal, not
 . computing devices with just the disk storage at the crux - FOR STORING USER AND INTERACTIVE DATA 
 . They connect to the Internet (satellites , towers , cables) and use it to deploy content to the client
   devices.

Clients :
 . devices that request and receive data
 . they DO connect to a LAN offered by the ISP
 -> the LAN pushes the client's requests (as digital PACKETS) via the Internet/ISP network to the server's network
 -> the requests eventually make it to the server
 -> the server fetches those requests and provides the demanded content (also as packets) - essentially , data
 -> the data makes it through the server's LAN , hen via the INternet , to the client's LAN
 -> the client receives the content 

Node :
 . a.k.a. network interface 
 . nodes are not just servers and clients 
 . they can be processes running on the same device as well 

Most devices are not purely servers or clients ; they usually function as both. 
 . The server to one device can be a client to another device. 
 . Ex. : the email server to you can be a client to a DNS server. 
 . We ascribe “server” or “client” to refer to the device’s primary purpose. 

Network topography : 
 . the physical aspect of a network ; a (physical) part of the Internet
