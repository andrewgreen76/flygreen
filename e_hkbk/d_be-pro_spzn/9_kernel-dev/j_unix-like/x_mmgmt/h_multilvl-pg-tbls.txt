Process segment paging leads to having too many invalidated pages.

Multi-level page table solves this problem : 
. a tree-like structure 
  . broken up pages of its own
  . MLPT pages are used for
    . PFN lookup
    . checking on validity of a PFN or translation 
  . a MLPT page full of invalid entries means the virt.pages under those entries will not have physical counterparts
    => entire groups of invalid entries are ignored, saving us lots of RAM 
  => TLB lookup -> MLPT page directory lookup
  . a page directory keeps track of MLPT pages
    . their validity
    . their corresponding physical addresses, if applicable 
. still used in modern architectures and systems

REMINDER : 

Present bit (P) : is it in RAM or the disk ?
. a.k.a. the valid bit - memory can be legally accessed
. invalid pages do not get corresponding frames ; this saves huge amounts of physical memory
