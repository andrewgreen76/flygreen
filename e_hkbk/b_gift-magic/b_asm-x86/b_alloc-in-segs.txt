... if you write `char input[10];` inside a function, it will be allocated on the stack. This is because `input` is a local variable with automatic storage duration, meaning it gets allocated on the stack when the function is called and deallocated when the function exits. 

In contrast, buffers allocated dynamically (e.g., with `malloc()`) or globally/static variables are placed on the heap or in the data segment, respectively.
