Here are the typical steps involved in CPU detection and initialization during the POST BIOS routine:

1. Identification of the CPU model and manufacturer.
2. Setting up the CPU's operating mode and configuration.
3. Initializing CPU caches and control registers.
4. Performing basic sanity checks to ensure CPU functionality.
5. Configuring CPU-specific features such as Hyper-Threading, Turbo Boost, or virtualization support.
6. Updating system firmware with any necessary microcode patches for the detected CPU.
7. Verifying CPU clock speeds and voltage settings.
8. Handing control over to the operating system bootloader for further initialization and booting.

These steps may vary slightly depending on the specific motherboard, BIOS firmware, and CPU architecture.
