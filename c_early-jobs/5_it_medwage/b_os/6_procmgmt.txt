PROCESS MANAGEMENT - ADDITIONAL NOTES 
===================================================================================

Program vs. process : 
 . a program is stored as a file or a group of files working together as source code
 . only once it is executed does it become a process - an instance of the program being run in RAM 
 . it is important to note that you can have multiple processes of the same program 


Process management by the kernel entails :
 . creation
 . scheduling
 . termination 


What is a VIRTUAL MEMORY really ?
 = RAM SPACE + SWAP SPACE on the disk , all assigned to the same process 


Conventional exectution of a program :
 . a program is targeted for execution 
 -> the program's source code - implementation and libraries - is broken up into pages
 -> these pages are stored in the virtual memory
 -> any page due for execution is to be moved to physical memory (RAM) 


I/O management :
 . the kernel doesn't just engage in a one-on-one with an I/O device (peripheral) using a driver
 . the kernel is expected to have the ability to regulate communication between the peripherals
