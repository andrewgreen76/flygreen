We construct a test in which each thread updates a single shared counter a fixed number of times; we then adjust the number of threads to determine the performance costs of the basic technique. The graph on the left displays the total time taken. Each thread updates the counter one million times.

The performance of the synchronized counter scales poorly, as seen by the top line in the picture (labeled ‘Precise’). This is because the million counter updates can be completed in a fraction of a second (approximately 0.03 seconds), but updating the counter one million times simultaneously results in a significant delay (nearly 5 seconds). It only gets worse with more threads.
