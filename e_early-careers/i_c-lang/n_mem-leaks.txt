When memory leaks occur within C++ code running on a device like a Dell Inspiron 14, the device's operating system is responsible for managing memory resources. The operating system employs various mechanisms to handle memory leaks and ensure efficient memory management. Here's a general overview of how memory leaks might be handled:

    Process Isolation: Each process running on the device, including C++ applications, operates in its own isolated memory space. This means that memory leaks within one process generally do not directly impact other processes or the overall system stability.

    Virtual Memory Management: The operating system utilizes virtual memory management techniques to allocate and deallocate memory for each process. It assigns virtual memory addresses to processes, and physical memory is allocated as needed. When a process terminates, the operating system reclaims the associated memory.

    Memory Tracking and Cleanup: Modern operating systems often include memory tracking mechanisms. They keep track of memory allocations and deallocations made by processes. If a process fails to deallocate memory, the operating system can detect such leaks. When the process terminates, the operating system releases the leaked memory, ensuring it becomes available for other processes.

    System Resources: If a memory leak occurs and continues to consume excessive memory, it can impact system performance. The operating system may employ resource management techniques to prioritize memory allocation for critical processes and avoid overall system degradation.

It's important to note that the device's operating system handles memory management and addresses memory leaks in a general sense, rather than specifically targeting C++ code. The responsibility for preventing and addressing memory leaks within the code primarily lies with the software developer. Proper memory management practices, including correctly allocating and releasing memory, are crucial to prevent memory leaks in the first place.

While the operating system can help clean up leaked memory after a process terminates, it is still essential for software developers to proactively address and fix memory leaks within their code to ensure optimal performance and efficient resource utilization.
