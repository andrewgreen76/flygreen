ELF VS. RAW BINARY : 
========================================================================================

raw binary (file) 
 . "a sequence of bytes WITHOUT ANY ACCOMPANYING HEADERS OR METADATA (to define its structure or execution context)."
 . .bin 

ELF binary (file) 
 . structured WITH HEADERS AND TABLES
 . no standard extension , .elf

OTHER TYPES OF BINARIES - OVERVIEW : 
========================================================================================


There are other types of binary files , so think about what their contents would look like.
Are they structured ? Do they have headers (with metadata) and/or tables ? Unique magic numbers ?


"
No, not all binary files are ELFs (Executable and Linkable Format). Binary files can be in various formats, depending on their purpose and how they are created. Here's a quick overview of different types of binary files:

### 1. **ELF (Executable and Linkable Format)**
   - **Usage**: Commonly used for executable files, object code, shared libraries, and core dumps on Unix-like systems (e.g., Linux).
   - **Features**: Contains headers that describe the file's layout and how it should be executed or linked.

### 2. **PE (Portable Executable)**
   - **Usage**: The standard format for executable files, object code, and DLLs on Windows systems.
   - **Features**: Contains headers and sections similar to ELF but specific to the Windows operating system.

### 3. **Raw Binary Files**
   - **Usage**: Files that contain raw machine code or data without any file headers or metadata. Often used for low-level programming, firmware, or as a part of a bootloader.
   - **Features**: No metadata or headers; just a sequence of bytes.

### 4. **COFF (Common Object File Format)**
   - **Usage**: An older format used for object files on various platforms, including early versions of Unix and some Microsoft systems.
   - **Features**: Contains headers and sections similar to ELF but in a different format.

### 5. **Mach-O (Mach Object)**
   - **Usage**: The standard binary format used by macOS and iOS for executables, object code, and shared libraries.
   - **Features**: Contains headers and sections specific to Apple's operating systems.

### 6. **Other Formats**
   - **Hexadecimal Files**: Files with hexadecimal representations of data, often used for programming EEPROMs or other firmware.
   - **S-records**: Text-based formats for representing binary data, used in embedded systems.

### Summary

- **ELF**: A specific format for Unix-like systems, used for executables and libraries.
- **PE, COFF, Mach-O**: Other executable formats for different operating systems.
- **Raw Binary**: Simple files with no headers or metadata, often used in low-level programming.

Different types of binary files serve different purposes and are used in different contexts, depending on the operating system and application requirements.

 .bin
   . unstructured code and data 
   . "raw, unstructured data or machine code, and its specific format and usage depend on the context in which it is created or used."
   . "Other kinds of binary files, such as `.o` object files or `.elf` executables, TYPICALLY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL PROCESSING or headers
      and cannot be directly loaded and executed on devices without being LINKED OR PROCESSED TO MATCH THE DEVICE'S MEMORY LAYOUT AND
      EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS." 

 .out
   . old Unix format

 .elf
   . a format for a structured binary executable in Unix-like systems
   . elf32 vs. elf64 

 .o
   . structured object files 

 .ko
   . Linux kernel module file format 
   . loaded into the kernel at runtime (without the need of a reboot)

 .so
   . format for SHARED OBJECT LIBRARIES for DYNAMIC LINKING and SHARED CODE in user applications IN UNIX-LIKE SYSTEMS
   . can be linked and loaded at runtime 
   . .so to user applications is what .ko is to the Linux kernel 

 .mod
   . music module file format 

 .prx
   . plugin files in software applications

 .puff
   . compressed binary for domain-specific systems and applications
   
 .axf
   . ARM executable

MORE ON a.out FORMAT : 
========================================================================================

"
The `a.out` file format is an older executable file format originally used by Unix systems. It stands for "assembler output" and was one of the first standard formats for executable files. Key characteristics include:

1. **Header Structure**: `a.out` files have a simple header that includes information about the file's size, entry point, and sections.
2. **Sections**: Typically includes a text (code) section, data section, and symbol table.
3. **Historical Use**: It was widely used in early Unix systems but has largely been replaced by more modern formats like ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) and COFF (Common Object File Format).

Although `a.out` has largely been superseded, its influence is seen in the design of later formats, and some legacy systems or tools may still use it.
