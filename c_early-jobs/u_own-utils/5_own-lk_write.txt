 . linkers and object files - NOT ISA-agnostic
 => I want my linker to be able to produce executables for :
    . x86
    -> ARM Cortex-M
    -> RISC-V
    -> [my custom ISA] 
 
 . linkers are typically implemented in a HLL like C
 
 . a linker - merely collates binary code in object files
     and produces the executable
 . the kernel - gets to store , load , and fire up the executable (and needs
     disk drivers for that)
