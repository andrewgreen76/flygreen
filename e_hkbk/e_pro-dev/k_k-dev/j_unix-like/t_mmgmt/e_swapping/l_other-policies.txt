Page selection policy :
. by which the kernel decides what page to load back into RAM and when 
  . demand paging :
    . pages are loaded into memory when needed by the process - a no-brainer 
  . prefetching 
    . the kernel knows what page will be needed in the future and loads it back into RAM
    . associative load : a neighboring page will be loaded in as well to sustain functionality  
    . "... should only be done when there is a good likelihood of success." 
  . prepaging
  . etc.



Disk-writing policies :
. technically also virtual memory (VM) policies 
. ex. : clustering 
  . pooling (bundling) multiple individual write-to-disk requests into one , more efficient write-to-disk operation
  . "... works because of the nature of disk drives, which can perform a single large write more efficiently than a series of little ones."
