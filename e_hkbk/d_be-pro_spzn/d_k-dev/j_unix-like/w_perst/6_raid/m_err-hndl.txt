RESPONDING TO ERRORS (FAULT TOLERANCE) : 
==================================================================================

How do we deal with errors detected with parity-based ECC ? 
 |
 . an error means we have a faulty disk
 => we need to identify the disk
 -> attempt to recover the data
 -> or attempt to fix the disk
 -> or replace the disk

==================================================================================
HOW TO IDENTIFY A FAULTY DISK :
==================================================================================

Automatically - RAID management software
 . since RAID is always connected to a server or a computer , that device will have
   the RAID management software that will point out which disk is faulty
 -> an admin will handle the problem 

Manually - an admin will detect the faulty disk :
 . the RAID controller simply signals that there's an error
 -> an admin comes over and looks into things (LEDs , etc.)
 -> the admin identifies the faulty disk 
 -> the admin handles the problem

Other notes : 
 . single-bit parity fails with an even number of errors
