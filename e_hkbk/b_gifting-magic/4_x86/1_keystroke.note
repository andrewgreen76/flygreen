What input does a computer receive based on a single keystroke?

When a computer receives a single keystroke from a keyboard, it typically generates a keyboard event and provides information about the key that was pressed. The specific input received may vary depending on the operating system and programming language being used, but generally, the computer receives the following information:

    Keycode: Each key on a keyboard has a unique identifier called a keycode. When a key is pressed, the computer receives the corresponding keycode, which indicates which key was pressed. For example, the keycode for the letter 'A' is different from the keycode for the spacebar.

    Character: Along with the keycode, the computer also receives the character associated with the pressed key. This character represents the actual symbol or letter printed on the key. For example, pressing the 'A' key will typically generate the character 'A'.

    Modifier keys: The computer also detects the state of modifier keys such as Shift, Ctrl, Alt, and the Windows or Command key. These keys modify the behavior of other keys and can create different characters or trigger specific actions when pressed in combination with other keys.

    Key state: The computer can determine whether the key was pressed (key down event) or released (key up event). This information allows for distinguishing between a single keystroke and a continuous key press.

These inputs are then used by the operating system or the application to perform the appropriate actions based on the key pressed, such as displaying the character on the screen, triggering a specific function, or navigating through a user interface.
