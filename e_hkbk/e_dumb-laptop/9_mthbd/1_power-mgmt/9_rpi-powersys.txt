The Raspberry Pi (RPi) uses a combination of components for its internal power delivery system:

1. **Micro USB or USB-C Port**: The primary means of powering a Raspberry Pi is through a micro USB or USB-C port, depending on the model. This port is connected to an external power source, such as a USB charger or a power bank.

2. **Voltage Regulator**: The voltage supplied through the micro USB or USB-C port is regulated to the required voltage levels by a voltage regulator on the Raspberry Pi board. This regulator ensures that the voltage remains stable and within the operating range of the components on the board.

3. **Polyfuse**: Many Raspberry Pi models include a polyfuse, which acts as a resettable fuse to protect against overcurrent conditions. If the current exceeds a certain threshold, the polyfuse temporarily interrupts the circuit and automatically resets once the current returns to a safe level.

4. **Protection Diodes**: Some Raspberry Pi models include protection diodes to safeguard against reverse polarity, preventing damage to the board if the power supply is connected incorrectly.

5. **Power Management IC (PMIC)**: More recent Raspberry Pi models, such as the Raspberry Pi 4, may include a power management IC (PMIC) to manage power distribution and efficiency. The PMIC can provide additional features like power gating to control power to different components on the board, as well as power saving modes to optimize energy usage.

Overall, the internal power delivery system of a Raspberry Pi is designed to provide stable and reliable power to the board's components while also offering protection against overcurrent and reverse polarity situations.
