Does not indent selected text (indent-region, C-M-\ do not work)



Hi, all. My first bug report ever right here.

Quite simply, whenever I select with Shift-[up/down arrow] lines of text
or code I want to indent, none of the indentation methods are working
but one. I attempt to perform a selection indentation and the Emacs command
line prints "Indenting region ... done", but no change has occurred. I tried :

(a) C-M-\ (on my Dell Inspiron 14 'Alt' is the Meta key);
(b) entering the 'indent-region' command after accessing the command
line with M-x; and
(c) just using 'Tab'.

I can't indent a selection with 'Tab', but 'Tab' is working where the
cursor is at and nothing is selected. Also, I discovered a rather
cumbersome way of indenting a selection: C-x, then TAB, then S-right. I
wish I had the expertise to help pinpoint where the bug could possibly
be, but all I really know is that the issue definitely goes at least as
far back as version 27.1 (which I installed with APT vs. this 29.1 which
I got with snap).

At this point, I feel providing anything else would be rather excessive, especially my 'lshw' breakdown. 

Let me know if you need anything else.
