WHY THE DEBATE OVER COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY ? 
========================================================================================

"
The debate exists because understanding problem complexity and solution verification is fundamental to IMPROVING ALGORITHMS, optimizing performance, and addressing real-world computational challenges. It helps in DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN FEASIBLE AND INFEASIBLE PROBLEMS, guiding research and practical applications in computer science.
"


"
We can achieve some goals without deeply analyzing problem complexity, but understanding it helps in making more informed decisions about algorithm design, resource allocation, and problem-solving strategies, ultimately leading to more efficient and scalable solutions.

 !!! Thinking about these things is IMPORTANT IN THE CONTEXT OF WORKING ON PROFESSIONAL PROJECTS
       where the product is meant for other people - the employer and the customers.

 !!! This is not just a question of "Is this fast ?" This is a question of "Is this fast enough
       for everyone ?" 


"
Examining problem complexity helps in UNDERSTANDING THE INHERENT LIMITS AND TRADE-OFFS OF DIFFERENT APPROACHES, guiding the design of faster algorithms by identifying the most efficient strategies and recognizing when fundamental limitations exist. It ensures that algorithm improvements are not just incremental but fundamentally address the challenges posed by the problem's complexity.
