For accessing Gmail in Emacs using the Gnus email client, you can use the `nnimap` backend. `nnimap` is suitable for accessing mailboxes using the IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) protocol, which Gmail supports.

Here's how you can set up Gmail with the `nnimap` backend in Gnus:

1. Open your `.gnus` file for editing. If it doesn't exist, create it in your Emacs configuration directory.

2. Add the following lines to configure the `nnimap` backend for Gmail:

   ```emacs
   (setq gnus-select-method '(nnimap "gmail"
                                     (nnimap-address "imap.gmail.com")
                                     (nnimap-server-port 993)
                                     (nnimap-stream ssl)
                                     (nnir-search-engine imap)
                                     (nnmail-expiry-wait immediate)))
   ```

   Replace `"gmail"` with a name of your choice for this mail source.

3. Set up your Gmail account credentials. To do this, you can use the `auth-source` library. Add the following lines to your `.authinfo.gpg` file:

   ```
   machine imap.gmail.com login your-email@gmail.com password your-app-password port 993
   ```

   Replace `your-email@gmail.com` with your Gmail email address and `your-app-password` with the generated App Password that you create in your Gmail settings. Make sure to protect your `.authinfo.gpg` file with appropriate permissions.

4. Save and close the `.gnus` file.

5. Restart Emacs or reload your configuration to apply the changes.

With these settings, Gnus will use the `nnimap` backend to access your Gmail mailbox over IMAP using SSL. You'll be able to read, send, and organize your Gmail messages directly from within Emacs.
