DRAWBACKS OF FLASH-BASED STORAGE : 
=================================================================================

 - subsequent writes to the same page can't be close to one another 
    . due to the physical properties of transistors in NAND flash memory
    . the transistors will be worn out
    . consecutive writes can be broken up with an erase 
 - before erasing/writing to a single flash page its entire block must be erased
    . physically it would be very impractical to design and develop a mechanism
      that can erase individual tiny pages
    . (this is especially true for multi-level cell (MLC) configurations)
