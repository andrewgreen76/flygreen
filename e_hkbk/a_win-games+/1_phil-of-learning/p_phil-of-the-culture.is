Programming is about learning systems, and systems are about wish fulfillment. Programming is about the “how”. The programmer knows how it’s done. Scripting is about wish fulfillment with ignorance on the part of the user. Scripting is about productivity. 

The most basic wish; more sophisticated wishes. 

Languages are abstractions; each one comes with a baggage.
