Initializing newly allocated memory (pages) is done to ensure that the content of those pages is predictable and well-defined from the start. This initialization is typically performed to avoid security vulnerabilities and bugs that could arise if the memory pages contain arbitrary or leftover data from previous use. There are several reasons for initializing new allocated memory pages:

1. **Security:**
   - Initializing memory helps prevent information leaks that could occur if sensitive data from a previous use of the memory pages is left unerased. For security reasons, it's crucial to ensure that data belonging to one process or user is not accessible to another.

2. **Predictable State:**
   - Initialization ensures that the content of the memory pages is in a known and consistent state. This predictability is essential for reliable program behavior and helps avoid bugs or unexpected outcomes caused by relying on uninitialized data.

3. **Programming Language Requirements:**
   - Some programming languages and runtime environments have requirements or expectations regarding the initial state of memory. Initializing memory ensures compliance with these requirements and helps developers write robust and reliable code.

4. **Debugging:**
   - Initializing memory can make it easier to identify bugs and programming errors related to uninitialized variables. Uninitialized memory can lead to unpredictable behavior, making it more challenging to diagnose and fix issues.

5. **Deterministic Behavior:**
   - Initializing memory ensures deterministic behavior, especially in situations where the program's correctness relies on specific initial values. This is important for applications that require a consistent starting state for their data structures.

While initializing memory pages is a common practice, it does come with a performance cost. To address this, demand page zeroing is employed in some systems. With demand page zeroing, the initialization is deferred until the point when the program actually writes data to the pages. This optimization helps improve efficiency by avoiding the unnecessary initialization of memory that may not be immediately used, striking a balance between security and performance considerations.
