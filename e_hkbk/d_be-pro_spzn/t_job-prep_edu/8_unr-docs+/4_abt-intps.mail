Hi,

I am looking to pursue a career in software engineering with a focus on development of kernels, drivers, and GPUs. I already have a B.S. in CSE with games and simulations as my specialization, but I want to pivot. I know I need experience with firmware programming but I don't know where or who to turn to in this case. I also know a lot of companies are looking for students pursuing M.S. and already possessing the right skillset. What would you recommend?
