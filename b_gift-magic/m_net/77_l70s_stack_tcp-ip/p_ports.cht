What is the port number for TCP/IP?
ChatGPT

The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP) are fundamental protocols of the TCP/IP protocol suite, which is used for communication and data transfer over the internet and many other computer networks.

In the TCP/IP protocol suite, there are several protocols and services that operate on different port numbers to provide specific functionalities. Some commonly used port numbers in the TCP/IP suite include:

    Port 80: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) for web browsing.
    Port 443: HTTPS (HTTP Secure) for secure web browsing.
    Port 25: SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) for email transmission.
    Port 110: POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3) for email retrieval.
    Port 143: IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) for email retrieval.
    Port 53: DNS (Domain Name System) for domain name resolution.
    Port 22: SSH (Secure Shell) for secure remote access.
    Port 21: FTP (File Transfer Protocol) for file transfer.

These are just a few examples, and there are many other protocols and services in the TCP/IP suite, each typically associated with a specific port number. The port numbers provide a way to direct network traffic to the appropriate protocols and services running on a particular device.

It's important to note that port numbers can be configured or customized for specific applications or network setups, but the well-known port numbers mentioned above are widely used as defaults for their respective protocols in the TCP/IP suite.
