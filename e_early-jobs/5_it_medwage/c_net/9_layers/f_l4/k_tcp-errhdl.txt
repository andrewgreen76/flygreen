A segment is missing :
 . the recipient will fail to reciprocate with a segment with an ACK=1 within a certain period of time per a timer
 . the sender will retransmit


A segment is corrupt : 
 . the recipient will send a segment with a PSH=1 , telling the sender to retransmit the entire chain of related segments 


Q : "Could you elaborate a bit on why TCP's specific mechanisms (like sequencing, acknowledgments, and retransmissions)
|    are so vital for handling medical records? What specific problems would arise if, for instance, a medical record
|    was transferred using a connectionless protocol like UDP, and some data was lost or arrived out of order?"
|
A : "These mechanisms promise data integrity and reliability. A failure in these mechanisms would mean receiving bad
     or corrupt data about a patient. The recipient device has to make sense of the received segments to put together
     user-friendly cohesive information about the needs of a patient. With a connectionless protocol the recipient
     medical office would not get coherent data and, ergo, assist their patient."
