`typedef` in C is used to create an alias for an existing data type, making the code easier to read and maintain. It does not create a new type but provides a new name for an existing one.

### Syntax:
```c
typedef existing_type new_name;
```

### Example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

typedef unsigned long ulong; // Create an alias for unsigned long

int main() {
    ulong a = 100; // Now 'ulong' can be used instead of 'unsigned long'
    printf("%lu\n", a);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- In this example, `ulong` is defined as an alias for `unsigned long`. This allows you to use `ulong` in place of `unsigned long`, improving readability.
- You can use `typedef` with structures, pointers, and other data types as well, making complex types easier to manage. For instance:

```c
typedef struct {
    int x;
    int y;
} Point;

Point p1; // Now you can use 'Point' as a type for variables
```

Here, `Point` is a new name for the struct type, simplifying its usage.
