An API framework is a collection of libraries, tools, and protocols that developers use to create and manage Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). An API is a set of rules, protocols, and tools for building software applications that allow different systems to communicate with each other.

An API framework provides a structured approach to building APIs by providing developers with a set of tools and conventions for creating and managing API endpoints, request and response formats, data models, authentication and authorization, versioning, documentation, and more.

Some popular API frameworks include Express.js for Node.js, Flask and Django for Python, Ruby on Rails for Ruby, Laravel and Lumen for PHP, and ASP.NET Core for .NET. These frameworks provide developers with pre-built functionality and conventions that allow them to build APIs quickly and efficiently, while also promoting best practices and maintainability.
