All registers are cleared. Then , ... reset vector : 

0x0000fff0	 ; IP (fetch instr @ resv) 
0x0000f000	 ; CS selector
0xffff0000	 ; CS base


CS base    + IP         = resv
0xffff0000 + 0x0000fff0 = 0xfffffff0

A CPU can be initialized without executing any code by configuring its internal registers and control units through hardware-based mechanisms such as power-on reset signals or configuration pins, ensuring basic functionality and readiness for code execution.
