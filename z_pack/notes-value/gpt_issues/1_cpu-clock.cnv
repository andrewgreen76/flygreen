The system clock is typically generated within the central processing unit (CPU) or the microcontroller, depending on the specific system architecture. It is an integral part of the CPU or microcontroller design and is often referred to as the "internal clock" or "core clock."

Inside the CPU or microcontroller, there is a dedicated clock generator circuit that generates the clock signal. This circuitry typically includes a crystal oscillator or other clock source, along with various frequency-dividing and shaping circuits to generate the desired clock frequency and waveform.

The generated clock signal is then distributed throughout the CPU or microcontroller to synchronize the activities of different internal components. It ensures that instructions are fetched, executed, and data transferred at the proper timing intervals.

While the system clock is usually generated within the CPU or microcontroller, it is worth noting that some systems may employ external clock sources or additional clock generation circuitry for specific purposes. For example, in complex systems or systems with multiple processors, there might be separate clock sources or clock distribution mechanisms for different components.

In summary, the system clock is typically located within the CPU or microcontroller, where it is generated and distributed to synchronize the operations of various internal components.
