Fair-share scheduling : 
. each job is supposed to get an equal share of CPU time 
. there's no such thing as the perfect scheduler 
. Usually processes that spend a good amount of their time with I/O do not get their fair share of CPU time.

Two ways to proportionally share scheduling between processes :
. lottery scheduling
. completely fair scheduling (using CFS)
  . considered to be one of the best options
