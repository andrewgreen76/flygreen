BIT SAMPLING:
===================================================================================

 . “To sample a bit means to measure the signal at a specific clock instant to determine whether it represents
      a 0 or a 1.”
 . “Detecting a bit at a logic level is essentially the result of sampling, since sampling provides the timing
      reference needed to reliably decide whether the signal is a 0 or a 1.”
 . “In other words, sampling stabilizes the signal by ensuring each bit is read at the correct time without
      ambiguity.”
