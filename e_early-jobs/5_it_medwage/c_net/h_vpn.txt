"A SECURE method of connecting a device to a PRIVATE NETWORK over the internet." 

===================================================================================
VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORKS (VPN) : 
===================================================================================

 . technology that extends a private LAN to a different, remote LAN 
 . typically used for business purposes by employees who are not in the office 
 . a “tunneling” protocol 
   . access to something remote 
   . “a VPN tunnel has been established” 
 . must have a dedicated VPN server coming with a router 
 . (VPN) client — tunnel — router — (VPN)server (of the company LAN)
 
 . On the client side the tunnel has a virtual interface - a networking interface with an IP address that matches
     the IP address of the (company) server.

 . Before transferring an IP datagram, the VPN encrypts it. 
   -> Then it encapsulates the datagram in a TCP segment / UDP datagram
   -> Then it encapsulates **that** in an IP datagram. 
   -> the datagram is transferred 
   -> the VPN will peel the IP datagram and decrypt the actual IP segment for the server 
   -> the IP datagram is encapsulated into an Ethernet frame and distributed through the server-side LAN 
 . a “general technology concept”, not a protocol (seeing that it can be designed/implemented in more ways than one)


===================================================================================
SITE-TO-SITE CONNECTIVITY : 
===================================================================================

 . server — router ———	 TUNNEL   — router — server
 . this allows two LANs / offices function as one

ALTERNATE TAKE ON VPN

VPN stands for Virtual Private Network. It is a technology that allows for secure and private communication over public networks such as the Internet. A VPN creates a virtual encrypted tunnel between a user's device (such as a computer, smartphone, or tablet) and a remote server or network, enabling the user to access resources and browse the internet securely and privately.

The main purpose of a VPN is to provide privacy and security by encrypting the data transmitted between the user's device and the VPN server. This encryption ensures that even if the data is intercepted, it cannot be read or accessed by unauthorized parties.

VPN technology also allows users to mask their IP address and appear as if they are accessing the internet from a different location. By connecting to a VPN server located in a specific geographic location, users can bypass geo-restrictions and access content or services that may be otherwise unavailable in their own region.

VPNs are commonly used for various purposes, including:

    Enhancing online privacy: VPNs encrypt internet traffic, preventing ISPs, governments, or hackers from monitoring or tracking users' online activities.

    Securing public Wi-Fi connections: VPNs protect users' data when connected to public Wi-Fi networks, which are often unsecured and vulnerable to attacks.

    Accessing restricted content: VPNs allow users to bypass censorship or access geo-restricted content by connecting to servers located in different regions.

    Remote access to private networks: VPNs enable users to securely connect to their workplace networks or access resources on private networks while working remotely.

There are various VPN protocols and implementations available, including OpenVPN, IPsec, L2TP/IPsec, PPTP, and more. Each protocol has its own strengths and considerations in terms of security, speed, and compatibility.
