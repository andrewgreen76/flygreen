You can write a makefile in Bash (or any shell scripting language) for Linux, but makefiles are typically written in their own specialized syntax rather than pure Bash scripting. Makefiles use a set of rules and variables to define how source code should be compiled and linked.

Here's a basic example of a makefile for a simple C program using GCC:

```make
# Define variables
CC = gcc
CFLAGS = -Wall
SOURCE = myprogram.c
OUTPUT = myprogram

# Default target
all: $(OUTPUT)

# Compile and link the program
$(OUTPUT): $(SOURCE)
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $(OUTPUT) $(SOURCE)

# Clean up object files and the executable
clean:
	rm -f $(OUTPUT)
```

In this example:

- We define variables like `CC` (the compiler), `CFLAGS` (compiler flags), `SOURCE` (source code file), and `OUTPUT` (name of the output executable).

- The `all` target is the default target, which specifies that running `make` without any arguments should build the `$(OUTPUT)`.

- The rule to build `$(OUTPUT)` specifies how to compile and link the program using the defined variables.

- The `clean` target is used to remove the generated executable and any intermediate files.

To use this makefile, you should save it in a file named "Makefile" (with a capital 'M') or "makefile" (with a lowercase 'm') in the same directory as your source code. Then, you can run `make` from the command line to build the program, and `make clean` to remove generated files.

Here's how you can use it:

```bash
# Build the program
make

# Clean up generated files
make clean
```

This is a very basic example, and makefiles can become much more complex depending on the requirements of your project. However, it should give you a starting point for creating makefiles for your Linux-based projects.
