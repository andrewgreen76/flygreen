 . "... the Busicom 141-PF did not have separate component controllers; the Intel 4004 microprocessor itself
      directly managed communication with the 4001 ROM and 4002 RAM chips."
 . "Typically, a memory controller has minimal processing capability for control logic but does not have
      significant memory of its own; it primarily orchestrates access to external memory."
 . "The processing ability for control logic in a microcontroller consists of simple, dedicated operations—like
    timing, state management, and signal coordination—handled by hardware circuits rather than general-purpose
      instruction execution."
 . "The first memory controller is generally considered to be the one integrated into the Intel 8086’s
      supporting chipset in 1978, which managed access to DRAM."
