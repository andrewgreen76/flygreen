THE ext4 FILE SYSTEM
===================================================================================

 . a file system native to the Linux kernel
 . An ext4-formatted storage drive can be read from and written to ***only by a Linux distro***, not
     a process on Windows.


===================================================================================
KEY DIRECTORIES IN THE LINUX FILE SYSTEM
===================================================================================

Enter "$ man hier" for the the Linux file system hierarchy.

/     - pwd: /
      - the root holds all files and directories for the system and all the user accounts

/home - pwd: /home
      - home for all user accounts

~    - pwd: /home/[yourname-or-else]
      - the prime directory for your user account 

/boot
- files needed by the bootloader
- holds the kernel and initramfs 

/bin
- basic commands and executables for a minimal system
- may be symbolically linked to /usr/bin 
- explore Program Files in Windows to find similarities

/sbin
- commands/execs/bins for the		SUPERUSER/ROOT
- (apps used to be statically linked , featured fewer library dependencies) 
- may be symbolically linked to /usr/sbin 

/home
- holds directories of individual users' homes (so it's a super-home, if you will)
- USER FILES exclusively

/[user-you]
- your personal files 
- user-specific configs 

/root
- home of the root user 

/etc
- ESSENTIAL/SYSTEM CONFIGS
- start-up scripts 
- stands for "editable text configuration"

/lib
- shared libraries for binaries the system would use
- in other words, processes share the same library code 
- may be symbolically linked to /usr/lib
- e.g. : lib (32-bit) , lib64 (64-bit) 

/tmp
- temporary files (downloads, keys, notes) 
- emptied at every reboot 
- can be	/var/tmp	-or-	/run/tmp

/var
- ever-changing records managed by the system 
- misc. variable files specific to and used by the OS (e.g., databases, email, history, etc.)
- /var/logs holds records of activity within the system
- temporary message files
- spool files
- system-specific configs
- web-server files (like in /srv) 

/usr (Unix System Resources)
- SOFTWARE INSTALLED BY USERS
- similar to /root
- utilities, extended system operations (i.e., non-essential to the system)
  => the files and directories here are not in /root
- e.g., /usr/bin , /usr/lib 

/dev
- files related to physical and virtual devices
- /dev/printer , /dev/audio , /dev/mem , /dev/networkcard
- "Everything is a file or directory."

===========================================================================================

/lost+found
- broken files post-crash (think coredump)

/media
- mount point for fs stored on removable media devices
- Linux may auto-mount the devices

/mnt
- "mount"
- keeps track of temporarily mounted devices (e.g., network storage server)
- permanent mounting is also possible

/opt
- optional software packages (placed by vendor(s))
- retained for software compatibility 
- rarely used

/proc
- holds info about every live process on the machine (every process has its own dir)
- holds info about the system, hardware, etc.
- a sudo fs (created at boot time, destroyed at shutdown)

/run
- info about the system since boot time (logged users, daemons)

/srv
- files served by web-servers and server protocols
- rarely

/sys
- info about devices , drivers , kernel features
- better structured than /proc 

.
