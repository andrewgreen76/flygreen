Can you create your own command in Bash?
ChatGPT

Yes, you can create your own command in Bash by creating a Bash script and adding it to a directory that is in your system's PATH. Here are the general steps:

    Open a text editor and create a new file.
    Add your Bash commands to the file, starting with the shebang #!/bin/bash at the top of the file.
    Save the file with a name that you want your command to have, for example mycommand.
    Change the file permissions to allow execution with the command chmod +x mycommand.
    Move the file to a directory that is in your system's PATH, such as /usr/local/bin. This can be done with the command sudo mv mycommand /usr/local/bin.

Once you have completed these steps, you should be able to run your command from the terminal by typing its name (mycommand in this example) and pressing Enter.
