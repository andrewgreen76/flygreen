Version control. 



In the context of version control and software development, SCM stands for "Source Code Management" or "Software Configuration Management." SCM refers to the practices, processes, and tools used to manage and control changes to the source code of a software project over time.

SCM, also known as version control, provides a systematic way to track, manage, and organize changes made to the source code throughout the development lifecycle. It helps software teams collaborate effectively, manage code changes, and maintain a historical record of the project's development.

Key features and benefits of SCM (versioning) include:

1. Version Tracking: SCM keeps a history of all changes made to the source code, including who made the changes, when they were made, and what specific modifications were introduced.

2. Collaboration: SCM enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously, facilitating collaboration and minimizing conflicts.

3. Branching and Merging: SCM allows developers to create branches, which are independent lines of development. Branching enables developers to work on separate features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase. Merging allows changes from one branch to be incorporated into another.

4. Rollback and Revert: SCM allows developers to roll back to previous versions of the code in case of errors or unintended changes. It also provides the ability to revert specific changes if necessary.

5. Code Review and Auditing: SCM provides a history of all changes, making it easier to review code modifications and conduct code audits.

6. Traceability: SCM provides traceability between code changes and issue tracking systems, allowing developers to link code changes to specific bugs or feature requests.

7. Continuous Integration and Deployment: SCM integrates with modern development practices such as continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), facilitating automated testing and deployment processes.

SCM plays a crucial role in modern software development, helping developers manage complex codebases, collaborate effectively, and maintain a stable and reliable software product. Git is one of the most popular and widely used SCM tools in the software industry, known for its distributed nature and powerful version control capabilities. Other notable SCM tools include Subversion (SVN), Mercurial, and Perforce.
