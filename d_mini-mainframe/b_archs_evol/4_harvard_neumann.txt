HARVARD ARCHITECTURE 
===================================================================================

 . code and data are in their own memory components or blocks
 => two separate busses
 
 . developed as a hardware design concept in 1930's
 . the term became popular in 1950's 


===================================================================================
VON NEUMANN ARCHITECTURE 
===================================================================================

 . code and data share the same memory block/space
 => one bus to access RAM

 . developed as a hardware design concept by John von Neumann in 1945

Here are several examples of computers and microcontrollers that use **Harvard architecture**:

1. **ARM Cortex-M series** (e.g., Cortex-M0, M3, M4) - Many microcontrollers based on these cores use Harvard architecture to separate program and data memory for improved performance.
2. **PIC microcontrollers** (e.g., PIC16, PIC18, PIC32) - These microcontrollers from Microchip often implement Harvard architecture, where program memory and data memory are physically separate.
3. **AVR microcontrollers** (e.g., ATmega series) - These microcontrollers from Atmel (now part of Microchip) use Harvard architecture for greater efficiency in small embedded systems.
4. **DSPs (Digital Signal Processors)** like **Texas Instruments TMS320** - Many DSPs use Harvard architecture to handle data and instructions more efficiently, often in parallel.
5. **MSP430** from Texas Instruments - A low-power microcontroller with Harvard architecture, designed for embedded applications.
6. **Intel i960** - A RISC processor that uses Harvard architecture in its design, often used in embedded systems and high-performance applications.
7. **Zilog Z8** - A microcontroller based on Harvard architecture, commonly used in embedded systems.
8. **Motorola 68000** (used in early systems like the Apple Macintosh) - While primarily Von Neumann, the 68000 had a modified Harvard architecture, particularly in its cache memory structure.
9. **Raspberry Pi Pico** - Based on the **RP2040** microcontroller, which uses Harvard architecture, offering separate instructions and data paths for efficiency in embedded projects.

Harvard architecture is commonly used in embedded systems, digital signal processing, and microcontrollers because it allows for faster and more efficient processing by enabling simultaneous access to instructions and data.

Here are several computers with Von Neumann architecture:

1. **IBM 704** - One of the first commercial computers to use a stored-program architecture based on the Von Neumann model.
2. **ENIAC** (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) - Though it was originally programmed via plugboards, later revisions of ENIAC used the Von Neumann model.
3. **Apple II** - Early personal computer that followed the Von Neumann architecture with a central processor (6502), memory, and I/O.
4. **IBM PC** (x86 architecture) - Based on Von Neumann principles, with a single memory space for program instructions and data.
5. **Commodore 64** - A home computer with the MOS Technology 6510 microprocessor, following the Von Neumann architecture.
6. **Zilog Z80-based systems** - Used in early home computers and embedded systems, implementing the Von Neumann architecture.
7. **Raspberry Pi** - A modern microcomputer using the ARM architecture, which is fundamentally based on Von Neumann principles.

Most general-purpose computers today, including desktops, laptops, and single-board computers, implement some form of Von Neumann architecture, even though many have optimizations like Harvard architecture for specialized components (e.g., GPUs).
