As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, the Raspberry Pi Zero is a compact single-board computer developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation. Here are the specifications of the Raspberry Pi Zero W, which is a variant of the Raspberry Pi Zero with wireless connectivity:

- **System-on-Chip (SoC):** BCM2835 by Broadcom
- **Processor:** ARM1176JZF-S running at 1 GHz (single-core)
- **Memory:**
  - 512MB of LPDDR2 SDRAM
  - No built-in Flash memory for program storage (program is loaded into RAM from an external source, usually a microSD card)

- **GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) Pins:** 40 GPIO pins
- **Video Output:** Mini HDMI port (1080p60 video output)
- **Camera Connector:** CSI camera connector for connecting the Raspberry Pi Camera Module
- **Wireless Connectivity:** Onboard Wi-Fi (802.11n) and Bluetooth 4.0 (only available in the Raspberry Pi Zero W variant)
- **USB:** One micro-USB OTG (On-The-Go) port for power and data
- **Power Supply:** 5V via micro-USB or GPIO header
- **Dimensions:** 65mm x 30mm (compact form factor)

Please note that the Raspberry Pi Zero W variant includes wireless connectivity (Wi-Fi and Bluetooth), while the original Raspberry Pi Zero does not have built-in wireless capabilities. Additionally, there may have been updates or new models released since my last update, so I recommend checking the official Raspberry Pi website or other reliable sources for the most current information on the Raspberry Pi Zero and its variants.
