To create a 16-bit ELF object file and executable using NASM and LD on an x86-64 Linux system, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Write the Assembly Code
Create a simple 16-bit assembly program, for example, `program.asm`:

```asm
section .text
    global _start

_start:
    ; Write your 16-bit code here
    mov ax, 0x4C00 ; DOS terminate process
    int 0x21       ; Interrupt call
```

### Step 2: Assemble the Code with NASM
Use NASM to assemble the code into a 16-bit ELF object file:

```bash
nasm -f elf32 -o program.o program.asm
```

Here, `-f elf32` is used because NASM doesn’t directly support creating 16-bit ELF files. Instead, we generate a 32-bit ELF object and ensure the code itself is written in 16-bit mode. The `bits 16` directive can be used in your assembly code if necessary.

### Step 3: Link the Object File with LD
Link the object file to produce a 16-bit executable:

```bash
ld -m elf_i386 -T link.ld -o program program.o
```

### Linker Script: `link.ld`
Create a linker script `link.ld` to properly link a 16-bit executable:

```ld
OUTPUT_FORMAT("elf32-i386")
ENTRY(_start)
SECTIONS
{
    . = 0x7C00; /* Load address for a 16-bit real mode program */
    .text :
    {
        *(.text)
    }
    /DISCARD/ : { *(.note.GNU-stack) }
}
```

### Step 4: Run or Debug the Executable
The output `program` will be a 16-bit ELF executable. However, since modern Linux systems don’t natively support running 16-bit real mode code, you'll likely need an emulator or virtual machine (e.g., QEMU, DOSBox) to run it.

Example for QEMU:

```bash
qemu-system-i386 -fda program
```

This process gives you a basic 16-bit ELF executable, albeit in a form that requires careful handling and likely won’t run directly on a modern OS without additional steps.
