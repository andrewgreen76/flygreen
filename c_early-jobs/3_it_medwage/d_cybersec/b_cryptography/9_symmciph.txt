SYMMETRIC CIPHER
===================================================================================

 . the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt the message


Substitution cipher:
 . THE MAPPING between the plaintext and the ciphertext (a substitution table) is THE KEY, not the algorithm
 . THE SUBSTITUTION process is THE ALGORITHM
 . ex.: the Caesar cipher
 . ex.: ROT13 (Caesar cipher with the key of 13) - the decryption process is the inverse of encryption

Stream cipher:
 . encrypting one character at a time
 . 1:1 relationship between the input and the output
 + faster
 + easier to implement
 - easier to crack if key generation and input handling are not done correctly
    . e.g., the same key is reused again and again
    . need an initialization vector (IV) with random data worked into the encryption key
    => the recipient will know how to extract the actual working key - the "master key" - within the encryption key
    => encryption key = master key + IV
    . decryption: the IV in plaintext is placed with the encrypted message, and thus the master key is extracted 

Block cipher:
 . the entire input is placed in a block of data with a fixed size
 . encrypted all at once
 . if the input is too long, the block can be multiplied as much as needed and the last block would then be padded
 + tough to crack
 - takes too long to implement and use
