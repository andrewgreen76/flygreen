The acronym "XDG" stands for "X Desktop Group" or "X Desktop Guidelines," depending on the context.

Initially, it referred to the "X Desktop Group," which was a collaboration of several desktop environment projects, including GNOME and KDE, to develop and standardize specifications for interoperability and integration between different components of a Linux desktop environment.

Over time, the scope of the XDG group expanded to cover more general desktop-related standards, and "XDG" began to stand for "X Desktop Guidelines." These guidelines cover various aspects of the desktop environment, including file and desktop icon standards, menu systems, MIME types, and more. These guidelines are intended to promote compatibility and consistency across different Linux desktop environments.

One of the most commonly used XDG standards is the XDG Base Directory Specification, which defines a set of common directories where user-specific and system-wide configuration files and data should be stored. This specification helps ensure that applications and desktop environments can find and manage configuration and data files in a consistent manner.

In summary, "XDG" originally stood for "X Desktop Group" but later came to represent "X Desktop Guidelines," which are a set of standards and specifications aimed at improving interoperability and consistency in Linux desktop environments.
