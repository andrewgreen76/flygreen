One key component of the Execution Unit (EU) that you left out is the Vector Processing Unit (VPU).

The Vector Processing Unit is responsible for performing operations on vectors or arrays of data in a single instruction, also known as SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) operations. It operates independently of the ALU and is optimized for handling parallel processing tasks such as multimedia processing, scientific computations, and signal processing.

The VPU typically includes its set of specialized registers, instruction set, and execution pipeline tailored for vector operations. It works in conjunction with the ALU and other components of the EU to perform SIMD operations efficiently.

Intel introduced the first Vector Processing Unit (VPU) in their microprocessors with the introduction of the Intel MMX (MultiMedia eXtensions) technology in 1997. MMX introduced SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions that allowed the CPU to perform operations on multiple data elements in parallel. This technology was primarily aimed at enhancing multimedia and gaming performance by accelerating tasks such as image and video processing. Later iterations of Intel's microprocessors, such as the SSE (Streaming SIMD Extensions) and AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions) instruction sets, further expanded and improved vector processing capabilities in subsequent processor generations.

SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) did not necessarily "replace" any existing technology, but rather it introduced a new approach to parallel processing within microprocessors.

Before the introduction of SIMD instructions, parallel processing was primarily achieved through techniques such as multiprocessing (running multiple independent processes concurrently on separate processor cores) or vector processing (performing the same operation on multiple data elements sequentially). These approaches were effective but had limitations in terms of efficiency and scalability.

SIMD instructions introduced a new paradigm where a single instruction could operate on multiple data elements simultaneously, allowing for more efficient parallel processing within a single processor core. This approach was particularly well-suited for tasks that involved processing large amounts of data in parallel, such as multimedia processing, signal processing, and scientific computing.

So, rather than replacing existing technologies, SIMD introduced a complementary approach to parallel processing that offered advantages in terms of efficiency, performance, and ease of programming for certain types of applications.
