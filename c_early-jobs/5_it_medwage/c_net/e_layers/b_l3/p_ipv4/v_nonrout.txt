RFC 1918 (1996) :
 . outlined a list of networks as "non-routable address space"


Some devices do not need to be connected to all of the Internet.


===================================================================================
NON-ROUTABLE ADDRESS SPACE :
===================================================================================

  . Devices with these addresses can communicate with one another on the same LAN but will not have a gateway
      router , thus remaining isolated.
  . dedicated exclusively to INTERNAL NETWORKING 
  => CANNOT BE ROUTED TO
  . FREE TO BE USED by anyone
  |
  . Network Address Translation (NAT) technology can help break those boundaries when the need arises.
  . “NAT (Network Address Translation) allows devices using non-routable (private) IP address space to communicate
    with the public internet by translating their private addresses to a routable public IP address.”


Three primary ranges :
 . 10.0.0.0/8 
 . 172.16.0.0/12 
 . 192.168.0.0/16 
 . Internal gateway protocols WILL ROUTE to these address spaces ; external gateway protocols are not applicable.
