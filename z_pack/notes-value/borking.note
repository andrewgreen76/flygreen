William S. There's been plenty of times where I borked my Linux system while writing shell scripts to automate Linux From Scratch. The problem was always a variable that was set incorrectly or left unchecked. Luckily I've never accidentally deleted my rootfs, but I have deleted files in /dev and needed to do a quick restart. The lesson I learned was to never run scripts as the root user unless absolutely necessary!
