Microcontroller:

    A microcontroller is a compact integrated circuit that combines a microprocessor core with memory, input/output (I/O) peripherals, and other functional units on a single chip.
    It is often used in embedded systems and designed for specific tasks or applications where cost, power efficiency, and compactness are important.
    Microcontrollers typically have integrated memory (both program memory and data memory), timers, analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), digital-to-analog converters (DACs), UARTs, GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) pins, and other peripherals.
    They are commonly used in applications such as robotics, consumer electronics, home automation, automotive systems, and industrial control systems.
