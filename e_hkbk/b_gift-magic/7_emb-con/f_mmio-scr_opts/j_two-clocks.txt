The master clock on the Raspberry Pi 4 board runs at a base frequency of 54 MHz. This frequency is generated by the crystal oscillator, which provides the reference clock signal for the entire system.

The 1.5 GHz frequency refers specifically to the operating frequency of the ARM Cortex-A72 CPU cores within the Broadcom BCM2711 SoC. These CPU cores execute instructions and perform computations at this higher clock speed.

It's important to distinguish between the system clock frequency, which is typically provided by a crystal oscillator and serves as a reference for timing operations across the entire system, and the CPU clock frequency, which determines the speed at which the CPU cores execute instructions.

In the case of the Raspberry Pi 4:

- The system clock frequency is 54 MHz, generated by a crystal oscillator.
- The CPU clock frequency is 1.5 GHz, which determines the operating speed of the ARM Cortex-A72 CPU cores within the SoC.
