Expect RPC congestion at the same server.

THREAD POOLS 
===========================================================================================

A server should be able to concurrently handle multiple requests.
=> the server should have a pool of threads
  |
  |
  . need a [STUB GENERATOR] on both the client and the server sides 
  |
  . the [MAIN THREAD] receives and sends messages 
  . each one of the [WORKER THREADS] handles a single RPC
  | 
  . locks may be necessary
