PIO OVERHEAD 
===========================================================================================

------------------------------------
 . PIO - programmed input/output.  |
------------------------------------

An I/O request is made , ... 
 |
 -> PIO spends CPU time copying data for I/O task to the disk
 |   . address after address
 |
 -> context is switched



===========================================================================================
DIRECT MEMORY ACCESS (DMA) 
===========================================================================================

DMA engine :
 . relieves the CPU of PIO copying burden


 |
 + [DMA CONTROLLER] moves data directly b/w ...  
 |  (A) RAM
 |  (B) I/O controllers (storage , cards , etc.)
 |
 . DMA uses [THE SAME BUSES] as the CPU 
 . bus mastering :
    . DMA bus arbitration process requests access to buses from the CPU when it's idle 



DMA functionality :
 |
 . OS tells DMA the [SIZE] and the [DESTINATION] of the data to be copied
 -> OS goes on about its business
 -> DMA controller performs the copying
 -> DMA controller is done , raises an interrupt to the OS
