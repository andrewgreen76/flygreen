Child process : gets an address space of its own

Threads : implemented abstractions that work like processes but share the same address space
. multiple execution locations
. parallelism
  . multiple threads have the ability to fetch and execute instructions at the exact same time 
  . ex. : performing and sharing I/O and non-I/O activities
  . "thus, many modern server-based applications (web servers, database management systems, etc.) use threads." 
. context switching applies to threads as well
. every thread has ... 
  . a single task
  . register values
  . a stack that is shared with other threads within the same address space
    => yes , threads can access any data within the same stack space of the same process 
     . stacks are usually not very big 
  . a thread control block (TCB), used to store and load the state of the thread
    . just like PCB, which stores and loads the state of a process

"Processes are better for logically independent tasks that require less memory sharing."
