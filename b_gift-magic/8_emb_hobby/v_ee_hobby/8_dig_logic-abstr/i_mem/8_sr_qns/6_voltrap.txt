TRAPPING A CHARGE IN A LATCH
===================================================================================

A: "A latch traps a peak voltage by using a SAMPLING SWITCH and STORAGE ELEMENT (typically a capacitor) that
    charges to the peak level and holds it when the switch opens."

Q: "I built a latch without a capacitor and it worked just fine."

A: "It worked because the latch’s transistors and wiring inherently provide PARASITIC CAPACITANCE and REGENERATIVE
    FEEDBACK, allowing the voltage state to be stored without an explicit capacitor."

   "Parasitic capacitance is the UNINTENDED CAPACITANCE THAT NATURALLY EXISTS between conductors and semiconductor
    junctions due to their physical proximity and materials."

   "It worked because parasitic capacitances in the devices and wiring stored enough charge to hold the voltage
    briefly, effectively acting as the capacitor."
