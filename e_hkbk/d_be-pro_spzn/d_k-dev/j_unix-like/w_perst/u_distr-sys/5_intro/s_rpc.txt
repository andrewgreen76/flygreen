"Programming language abstractions make far more sense than OS abstractions for constructing distributed systems. The most common abstraction is a remote procedure call, or RPC."



====================================================================================
REMOTE PROCEDURE CALL (RPC) 
====================================================================================

Shape/form :
 . a mechanism that follows a method
 . there are APIs that can help realize this mechanism 

Goal :
 . optimization of executing code of the process from the 2nd party 
 . "as straightforward as calling a local function"



Method :
 . CLIENT-SERVER ARCHITECTURE 
 . server bundles up functions and routines of the process API
 . in an RPC 
 . RPC



 . RPC's come in packages
