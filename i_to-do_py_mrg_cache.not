. Difference : a part of an OS
  . boot sector in .asm
. explore /dev/* (/zero, /null, etc.)

- an emulator (VM) 
- learn BIOS-kernel-API/DSP-distro ladder for that 
- An API / display server protocol for a 13h-like mode portable to any server-like system.

Suppose I want to write a very dumb bootloader. I know that to do that an assembly file needs to be written and converted to binary. The first 512 bytes would be the boot sector (with the last two bytes being 0x55 0xAA).

statically typed - determined/accessible at compile-time
dynamically typed - accessible during runtime. 
objects :
- structs :
  - organization,
  - (using ptrs to build and manip. data structures - not to be confused with structs)
    - data structures retain node organization
    - data structures retain their own organization
    - data structures help us use memory economically (keep us away from memory bottlenecking) 
- (unions) 
ptrs :
- problems w/o ptrs:
  - tying objects together to make structures
- purpose:
  - dyn.memgmt,
  - distant recall
  - aliasing ("I hate having to write the long identifier for the same object")
