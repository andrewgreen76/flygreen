============================================================
A LIST OF PEOPLE TO THANK.

I'm sure that no one on the list is perfect. And as far as
I know, no one on this list was involved in rape, murder,
or the Jan. 6 insurrection, so we should be fine. 
============================================================

	KATHLEEN BOOTH		- You let us talk to the machines. Eternally grateful. 
	
Ken Silverman, Nick Newhard	- For giving us Blood and the Build engine. If it wasn't for Blood, I probably
    	       	    		  wouldn't be doing this.
				  
Jon Van Caneghem		- For giving us the truly unique experience with "Heroes of Might and Magic".
    				  I don't even like racing, but I'd totally race with you. 
				  
David Mullich			- For continuing Jon's work, allowing art and mechanics come in a wonderful synergy.
      				  And HoMM III has some of the most breathtaking video game music. And you let it happen. 

Paul Romero			- Music has the potential to serve you as a companion in any situation. Games are
     				  no exception. The spirit and the soul from the sound realm enchances our gaming
				  experiences profoundly. The GOAT of game OST composition. 

David Brevik		- Yes, you are a superhuman in your own right. You give addiction a good name. I hate
      			  to admit it, but perhaps the pain of the crunch over the Diablo games was worth it.

John Carmack		- I will forgive the history of politics within id, even if
     			  reasons and memories have a way of lingering. A person who
			  pursues innovation with great passion and tremendous skill,
			  allowing technologists and non-savvies alike make powerful
			  memories, will always hold a special place in my heart. 
|
John Romero, Tom Hall	- I don't even want to know what id would be like without you guys. I sincerely hope
     	     	 	  that the worst is actually behind you, you are still doing you, and still create
			  the things that bring joy into our lives as well as your own.

Adrian Carmack		} 
Kevin Cloud		} You guys were seminal fucking artists, and art suffers without 
Sandy Petersen		} personality. 
American McGee		} 

Tim Cain 		- The Fallout Post-Mortem taught me a lot, not just about the game.
    			  It inspired me to challenge my insecurities and find something
			  to be passionate about. Why would one man start bleeding all on
			  his own for an ambitious and daunting project?

... and a thank you to everybody else involved in helping these games come to life. 

Dennis Ritchie	 	- People talk a terrible game about C. It won't change the fact that it is still
       			  an important, foundational, fun language to learn, and people still use it. You can't
			  really appreciate the way systems work without it. 
			  
Ken Thompson
Brian Kernighan

Richard Stallman	- Developers are users too ... and not all users are alike.
			  Thank you. 

Andre LaMothe 		- "The Black Art of 3D Game Programming" is 1200 pages. It has
      			  one author ... and that person has great knowledge and a deep
			  understanding of C and Assembly, old as those iterations are
			  now. This put things in perspective for me and helped me
			  cultivate the "can do" attitude. And you are also actually
			  a hardware engineer! Jesus Christ! But if you know that there is
			  one other person who can do it all, how or why would anyone be
			  too faint-hearted to do the same? "The journey of a thousand
			  miles begins with a single step.

Mitchell Waite		- I know your work is old now and the days of MASM and DOS are
	 		  gone, but just because something is old doesn't mean we have
			  to throw it away. And thank you for being an inspiration to
			  others like Andre.

Jay LaCroix		- People should be able to build a good perspective on Linux,
    			  understand what it means to think like a true professional, and
			  appreciate the fact that these things can help them on a very
			  deep level. It's a key to happiness. 

Terry A. Davis		- I know you said some foul things. I also know you had mental
      	 		  health issues like schizophrenia. I also know that you single-
			  -handedly crafted an entire operating system. People may not
			  like you, but they have to respect what you did. Inspirational. 

Zach Barth		- Singular games. TIS-100 and Last Call BBS gave me a direction
     			  in my tech life. Anything pertaining to languages and systems is
     			  a blast. And you closed Zachtronics with a bang, a favorite!
			  "Ever wonder how we put out a game a year and they almost 
			  never crash? C#."

Tarn and Zach Adams	- Sorry, I didn't get to play Dwarf Fortress much. However, 
     	      		  the notion that you could be a two-person team and do it all
			  by yourselves for breadcrumbs? Seemed kind of insane to me
			  at the time. 

Mike Judge    		- This guy fucks! (But I will overlook the stuff with Jackass!)

Lex Fridman		- Thank you for creating an outlet for sharing. It actually makes
    			  me truly appreciate the concept of sharing. 

Jim Keller		- I probably will never know as much as you do, but the way you
    			  talk about hardware and what you know about quality leadership
			  are reasons enough for people to wish they were you. Still
			  somewhat shocked by what you said about the x86 ISA, but you
			  know better.
