SystemC
===================================================================================

"SystemC is a set of C++ classes and macros that provide a system-level design and verification language.
   It extends C++ with constructs for hardware modeling and simulation, allowing designers to model and
   simulate concurrent processes and hardware components at a higher level of abstraction than traditional
   hardware description languages (HDLs) like VHDL or Verilog. SystemC is used for designing and verifying
   complex systems-on-chip (SoCs) and embedded systems.
