BIOS is typically written in assembly language or a higher-level programming language, compiled into machine code, and then programmed into the motherboard's ROM (Read-Only Memory) using specialized programming tools or utilities provided by the motherboard manufacturer.

The tools and utilities involved in programming BIOS into a motherboard's ROM can include:

1. Flash Programming Tools: Software utilities provided by the motherboard manufacturer or third-party vendors to write BIOS firmware onto the ROM chip.

2. Flash Programming Hardware: Specialized hardware devices, such as EEPROM programmers or flash programmers, used to physically interface with the ROM chip on the motherboard and write data to it.

3. BIOS Editors: Software tools that allow developers to modify and customize BIOS firmware before programming it onto the ROM chip.

4. Debugging Tools: Tools used for troubleshooting and debugging BIOS code during development and testing phases, which may include in-circuit emulators, debuggers, and simulators.

5. Firmware Development Kits (FDKs): Development kits provided by chipset manufacturers or BIOS vendors to aid in the creation, testing, and deployment of BIOS firmware.

6. Manufacturer-Specific Tools: Some motherboard manufacturers may provide proprietary tools or utilities for programming BIOS firmware onto their products, which are typically tailored to their specific hardware platforms and firmware requirements.
