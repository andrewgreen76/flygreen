DIFFERENT FORM FACTORS FOR THE SAME TYPE OF TRANSISTOR
===================================================================================
"
BJTs do not have a single specific form factor; they come in various packages (e.g., TO-92, SOT-23, TO-220)
  depending on power rating, application, and thermal requirements.

"
BJT form factors, sorted by typical size and application:
 . SMD (smallest): SOT-23, SOT-323, SC-70 (signal, low-power)  
 . Through-hole small: TO-92, TO-18 (general-purpose, low-power)  
 . Medium power: TO-126, TO-225 (audio, drivers)  
 . High power: TO-220, TO-247, TO-3P (power supplies, amplifiers)  
 . Surface-mount power: DPAK (TO-252), D2PAK (TO-263), PowerSO-10 (high-current SMD)  
 . Legacy/Industrial: TO-3 (metal can, high power, heat sink mount)

Yes, MOSFETs and other transistor types also come in various form factors (e.g., TO-220, DPAK, SO-8, QFN) tailored
  to power dissipation, switching speed, and application-specific needs.
