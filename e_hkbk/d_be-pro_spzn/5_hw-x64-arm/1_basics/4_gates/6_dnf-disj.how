Consider behavior outlined in the following truth table :

x	 y	  z	   f

0	 0	  0	   1   
0	 0	  1	   0
0	 1	  0	   1
0	 1	  1	   0
1	 0	  0	   1
1	 0	  1	   0
1	 1	  0	   0
1	 1	  1	   0

How do we write a boolean expression, a circuit representation, for this kind of behavior ?
The expression below is a way of describing such behavior and it is called the DISJUNCTIVE NORMAL FORM : 

(x' . y' . z') + (x' . y . z') + (x . y' . z')



From the info above we can infer that TRUTH TABLES are good for thinking about CONDITIONS.
