Yes, there are CPU boards where you can easily swap out the CPU. These boards are often designed for flexibility and upgradability, allowing users to replace the CPU with a different model or generation without requiring significant changes to the overall system.

One common example is the use of CPU socketed motherboards in desktop computers. These motherboards feature a socket into which the CPU is inserted, allowing for easy removal and replacement. Users can upgrade the CPU by simply removing the old CPU and inserting a new one that is compatible with the socket.

Similarly, in some server and workstation systems, there are CPU boards or modules that allow for easy swapping of CPUs. These systems may use blade server architectures or modular designs where CPU modules can be inserted or removed as needed.

Additionally, in embedded systems and industrial computers, there are CPU modules or boards designed for easy replacement. These systems often use standardized form factors such as COM Express or Qseven, allowing for interchangeability of CPU modules without redesigning the entire system.

Overall, the availability of CPU boards with easy swap-out capabilities depends on the specific design and intended use of the system. However, in many cases, manufacturers prioritize flexibility and upgradability to meet the needs of users who require the ability to easily replace or upgrade the CPU.
