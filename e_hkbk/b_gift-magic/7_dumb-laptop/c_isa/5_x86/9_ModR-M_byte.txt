You're correct; I apologize for the oversight. Let me correct that.

In 32-bit x86 assembly language, the "mov eax, ebx" instruction moves the contents of the EBX register into the EAX register. Here's the correct binary representation:

The opcode for the "mov" instruction is typically `8B /r`, where:
- `8B` is the hexadecimal representation of the opcode.
- `/r` indicates that the instruction uses the ModR/M byte to specify the registers involved.

For "mov eax, ebx":
- The opcode is `8B`.
- The ModR/M byte specifies the source (EBX) and destination (EAX) registers, which is `11` for both.

Putting it all together:
- Opcode: `10001011` (in binary, or `8B` in hexadecimal)
- ModR/M byte: `11000111` (for EBX as source and EAX as destination)
- Therefore, the complete binary representation would be:
```
10001011 11000111
```

The ModR/M byte in this case specifies the source and destination registers for the "mov" instruction. Here's the breakdown:

- Bits 7-6 (Mod): This field specifies the addressing mode. Since we're dealing with register-to-register move, the Mod field is `11` (binary).

- Bits 5-3 (Reg/Opcode): This field specifies the destination register. For "mov eax, ebx," the destination register is EAX, which is encoded as `000`.

- Bits 2-0 (RM): This field specifies the source register. For "mov eax, ebx," the source register is EBX, which is encoded as `011`.

Therefore, the ModR/M byte is `11000111` in binary, representing the addressing mode `11` (register), the destination register EAX, and the source register EBX.
