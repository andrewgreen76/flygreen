Yes, there are other functions in the `exec()` syscall family that provide simpler interfaces compared to `execve()`. These functions are designed to cover common use cases with default behaviors and are often easier to use. Some of the simpler `exec()` functions include:

1. **`execl()` and `execle()`:**
   - These functions take a variable number of arguments, specifying the program to execute and its arguments as separate parameters.
   - Example (`execl`):
     ```c
     #include <unistd.h>

     int execl(const char *pathname, const char *arg0, ... /*, (char *)NULL */);
     ```
   - Example (`execle`):
     ```c
     #include <unistd.h>

     int execle(const char *pathname, const char *arg0, ... /*, (char *)NULL, char *const envp[] */);
     ```

2. **`execv()` and `execvp()`:**
   - These functions take an array of pointers to null-terminated strings representing the program and its arguments.
   - Example (`execv`):
     ```c
     #include <unistd.h>

     int execv(const char *pathname, char *const argv[]);
     ```
   - Example (`execvp`):
     ```c
     #include <unistd.h>

     int execvp(const char *file, char *const argv[]);
     ```

These functions automatically construct the argument list and the environment variables, making them simpler to use for specific scenarios. However, keep in mind that they have limitations, such as the maximum number of arguments they can handle. If you need more control over the environment or have a complex set of arguments, you might still prefer using `execve()`.

Choose the appropriate `exec()` function based on your specific requirements and the level of control you need over the execution environment.
