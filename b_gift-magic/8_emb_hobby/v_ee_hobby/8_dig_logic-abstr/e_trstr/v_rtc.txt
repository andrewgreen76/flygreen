REAL-TIME CLOCK (RTC)
===================================================================================

 . the secret heartbeat of an embedded system


"
A real-time clock (RTC) is a clock (usually a dedicated low-power IC or module) that keeps accurate time and
  date even when the main system is powered off, typically using a crystal oscillator and a backup battery or
  supercapacitor.
"


"
A typical small supercapacitor (0.1 F to 1 F at 5.5 V) used for RTC backup can sustain a low-power real-time
  clock (drawing ~1 µA) for anywhere from several days to several weeks, depending on its capacitance, leakage
  current, and temperature — commonly 1–4 weeks in practical designs.
