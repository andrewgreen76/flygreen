The Instruction Queue or Instruction Decode Buffer is indeed utilized during normal execution as well. It helps in improving performance by prefetching and buffering instructions ahead of time, allowing the CPU to execute them efficiently without waiting for each instruction to be fetched individually from memory. This mechanism aids in reducing the latency associated with memory accesses and enables more effective instruction execution pipelines.

During boot time, when fetching and decoding instructions from BIOS, the CPU primarily utilizes the Instruction Pointer (IP) register to fetch instructions, and while decoding, it may use the Instruction Queue, but not the Memory Address Register (MAR) or Memory Data Register (MDR).

Up to 6 instructions :
|
"
The Intel 8086 processor had a relatively small instruction queue compared to modern processors. It could hold up to 6 instructions in its queue. This limited capacity meant that the processor could prefetch and store a small number of instructions ahead of execution, helping to improve instruction throughput and overall performance. However, compared to modern processors, the instruction queue of the 8086 was relatively small due to the architectural constraints and technology available at the time of its design.

Up to 16 instructions :
|
"
The Intel 80486 processor, or i486, introduced a larger instruction queue compared to its predecessors. It had a 16-byte instruction queue, which allowed it to hold up to 16 instructions in the queue. This increase in capacity compared to earlier processors like the 8086 enabled the i486 to prefetch and store more instructions ahead of execution, improving instruction throughput and overall performance.
"



Up to 32 instructions :
|
"
The Intel Pentium Pro processor introduced a significantly larger instruction queue compared to its predecessors. It featured a 40-byte instruction queue, capable of holding up to 32 instructions. This substantial increase in capacity allowed the Pentium Pro to prefetch and store a larger number of instructions ahead of execution, enhancing instruction throughput and overall performance compared to earlier processors.
"



Up to 128 instructions :
|
"
The Intel Itanium processor, also known as IA-64, had a relatively large instruction queue compared to previous x86 processors. It featured a 128-entry instruction buffer, allowing it to hold up to 128 instructions in the queue. This substantial capacity allowed the Itanium processor to prefetch and store a significant number of instructions ahead of execution, enabling efficient instruction scheduling and execution in its EPIC (Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing) architecture.
