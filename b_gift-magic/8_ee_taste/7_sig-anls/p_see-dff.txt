We want to enforce sequential flow of binary instructions and data in a controlled , synchronized (carefully "orchestrated") way. 
 . feedbacking and stabilization may not always give us that 
 . (we don't want spontaneous analog signal oddities) 
 => NEED A CLOCK - to separate one instruction or piece of data (state 1) from another (state 2)
