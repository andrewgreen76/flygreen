OLD UNIX - PERFORMANCE ISSUES :
================================================================================

Fragmentation : 

 - would become extremely poor very quickly
 - the disk was used as RAM 
   - super-slow access
   - new huge files are fragmented 
     - takes time to seek from block to block

 + defragmentation software - use it when time allows
   . data is compacted together , free space is compacted together
   + significantly reduces seeking time
   . rewrites the inodes accordingly 

================================================================================

512-byte blocks :

 - did not give the right balance , so two problems lingered :
   - blocks too large => internal fragmentation (in-block wasting) 
   - blocks too small
     => external fragmentation (too many small free pockets) 
     => more blocks to handle
       => more time spent accessing/moving blocks 
       => more metadata to be logged for all the blocks
