  alternatives to unhealthy solutions, etc.) 
- (especially for beginners)
  - hone their programming skills,
  - internalize key programming and engineering concepts,
  - learn about different systems,

__________________________________________________________________________

- a virtual machine,
- an emulator,
- or a video game that poses as an operating system (a la Last Call BBS).
  - Can I use the Unity Engine for that?
  - research dedicated toolchains. 
- challenge: faithful resolution
- plan of attack:
  - fide: 320x200
  - now: 1920x1200, 6 times both ways.
  - consider fair, authentic scaling. 
- learn BIOS-kernel-API/DSP-distro ladder for that
