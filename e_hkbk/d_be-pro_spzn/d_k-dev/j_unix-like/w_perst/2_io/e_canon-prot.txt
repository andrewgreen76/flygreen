CANONICAL PROTOCOL (OS + canonical device) : 
============================================================================================================================================================

 . POLLING for "ready"	<-|status| : ready
 |
 . SENDING DATA         ->|data|
 |
 . WRITING A COMMAND	->|command|
 |
 . POLLING   		
     for finished	<-|status| : not ready		 - No switching is offered. 
      or error			     	 		   => CPU TIME IS WASTED ON AN UNINTERRUPTED I/O TASK (DUE TO POLLING) 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Solution - interrupts (for context switching) :
 |
 . OS enables an interrupt, which ... 
   + sends a request (cmd + data) to the device
   + puts the irrelevant ongoing process to sleep
      . the I/O subsystem would handle the I/O on a separate thread 
   + switches context to another task
   |
   -> I/O operation is fulfilled
   -> interrupt to switch context to kernel mode
   -> call an interrupt handler from the kernel
   -> handler terminates the request
   -> current CPU task is aborted / put to sleep 
   -> handler wakes up the sleeping process


 + Interrupts allow for concurrency => efficiency. 
 - Context switching takes time. 
   => leveraging interrupts for an I/O task that ends very quickly is not worth it. 
 |
 |
 => use polling for short jobs 
  . use interrupts for longer jobs
  . use both if the device speed is unknown
