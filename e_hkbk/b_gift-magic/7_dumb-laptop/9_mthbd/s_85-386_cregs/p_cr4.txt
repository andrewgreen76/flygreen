CR4 is used in protected mode and long mode (64-bit mode) to control various system features and processor extensions. It includes bits that enable and disable features such as virtualization (VMX), various operating system support bits, and other architectural extensions.

Control Register 4 (CR4) is a special-purpose register in the x86 architecture that is used to control various system-wide features and configurations of the processor. It was introduced with the Intel Pentium processor, which was released in 1993.

CR4 is a 32-bit register that holds control flags for configuring specific features and behaviors of the processor. These flags provide control over various system-level configurations and functionalities.

Some of the key control flags found in CR4 include:

1. **Virtual 8086 Mode Extensions (VME)**: When set, this flag enables support for the Virtual 8086 Mode, which allows multiple virtual MS-DOS environments to run concurrently on a protected-mode operating system.

2. **Protected Mode Virtual Interrupts (PVI)**: This flag enables support for protected-mode virtual interrupts, which allows interrupt handling in virtual-8086 mode without switching to real mode.

3. **Time Stamp Disable (TSD)**: When set, this flag disables the ability of the Time Stamp Counter (TSC) to count processor clock cycles.

4. **Debugging Extensions (DE)**: This flag enables support for debugging extensions, including I/O breakpoints, hardware breakpoints, and task switching debug register access.

5. **Page Size Extensions (PSE)**: This flag enables support for larger page sizes (4MB pages) in addition to the standard 4KB pages.

6. **Physical Address Extension (PAE)**: This flag enables support for physical address extension, allowing the processor to address more than 4GB of physical memory.

7. **Machine Check Exception (MCE)**: This flag enables support for machine check exception handling, which allows the processor to detect and report hardware errors.

CR4 provides control over various advanced system-level features and functionalities, allowing the processor to adapt to different operating environments and usage scenarios. It is an essential component of the x86 architecture's system control mechanism and has been present in Intel microprocessors since the introduction of the Pentium processor.
