The GNU General Public License version 2 (GPLv2) was also authored by Richard Stallman and was published by the Free Software Foundation (FSF). The GPLv2 was released in 1991 as an updated version of the original GNU GPL, incorporating revisions and improvements based on feedback and experience with the earlier version. Like the original GPL, the GPLv2 is a copyleft license designed to protect and preserve the freedoms of users and developers in the world of free software. It has been widely adopted and has played a significant role in the open-source software community.
