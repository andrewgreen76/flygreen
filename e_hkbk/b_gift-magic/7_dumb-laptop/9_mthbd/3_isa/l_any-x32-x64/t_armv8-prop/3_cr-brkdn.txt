In ARMv8 architecture, there isn't a single "control register" that encompasses all control functions. Instead, control functions are typically distributed across multiple control registers, each responsible for specific aspects of the processor's operation. However, I can provide a breakdown of some commonly used control registers in ARMv8 architecture:

1. **CPSR (Current Program Status Register)**:
   - Bit 0 (N): Negative condition code flag.
   - Bit 1 (Z): Zero condition code flag.
   - Bit 2 (C): Carry condition code flag.
   - Bit 3 (V): Overflow condition code flag.
   - Bit 4 (Q): Saturation condition code flag.
   - Bit 5 (GE): Greater than or Equal condition code flags (used in SIMD instructions).
   - Bit 6-7: Reserved.
   - Bit 8-23: IT (if-then) state bits.
   - Bit 24 (J): Jazelle state bit (deprecated).
   - Bit 25 (T): Thumb state bit.
   - Bit 26-27: Reserved.
   - Bit 28 (IT): IT (if-then) execution state bit.
   - Bit 29 (G): Non-secure state bit (in AArch64).
   - Bit 30 (A): Asynchronous abort mask bit.
   - Bit 31 (I): IRQ interrupt mask bit.

2. **SCTLR_EL1 (System Control Register EL1)**:
   - Various bits control system-wide settings such as cache behavior, memory management, instruction set state, and exception handling.

3. **TTBR_EL1 (Translation Table Base Register EL1)**:
   - Bits specify the base address of the translation tables for the Memory Management Unit (MMU) in EL1.

4. **SPSR_EL1 (Saved Program Status Register EL1)**:
   - Similar to CPSR, but used to save the program status register during exceptions and interrupts.

5. **CPACR_EL1 (Architectural Feature Access Control Register EL1)**:
   - Controls access to coprocessors.

6. **SCR_EL3 (Secure Configuration Register EL3)**:
   - Controls various security-related features in EL3.

7. **HCR_EL2 (Hypervisor Configuration Register EL2)**:
   - Controls various virtualization-related features in EL2.

This breakdown provides a high-level overview of some key control registers in ARMv8 architecture, but the specific functionalities and bit assignments may vary depending on the processor implementation and specific system configuration. Additionally, ARMv8 architecture includes various other registers that control other aspects of the system's operation, such as debug, performance monitoring, and power management.

The term "control register" in the context of a 32-bit ARM architecture isn't specific enough to provide a bit-for-bit breakdown without further clarification. ARM architectures typically have multiple control registers, each serving a specific purpose in controlling various aspects of the processor's behavior.

However, one commonly referenced control register in ARM architectures is the Program Status Register (PSR), also known as the Current Program Status Register (CPSR) in ARMv4 and earlier, or the Current Program Status and Control Register (CPSR) in ARMv5 and later.

The CPSR is a 32-bit register that contains various flags and control bits that affect the processor's operation. Below is a general breakdown of the CPSR bits in ARMv7-A architecture (which is 32-bit):

```
|  31  | 30  | 29  | 28  | 27  | 26  | 25  | 24  | 23  | 22  | 21  | 20  | 19  | 18  | 17  | 16  |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| N (Negative flag) | Z (Zero flag) | C (Carry/Borrow flag) | V (Overflow flag) | Q (Saturation flag) |
```

```
|  15  | 14  | 13  | 12  | 11  | 10  | 9   | 8   | 7   | 6   | 5   | 4   | 3   | 2   | 1   | 0   |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| IT[7:0] (If-Then state bits) | GE[3:0] (Greater than or Equal flags) | - | E (Endianess flag) | A (Asynchronous abort disable flag) | I (IRQ interrupt disable flag) | F (FIQ interrupt disable flag) | T (Thumb mode flag) |
```

This is just a general overview, and the specific meaning and usage of these bits may vary depending on the ARM architecture version and the specific processor implementation. For a complete and accurate bit-for-bit breakdown, it's essential to refer to the relevant ARM architecture reference manual or technical documentation provided by ARM Holdings.

In ARM architecture, particularly in ARMv7 and ARMv8 architectures, the "control word" isn't a specific term used to describe a single register or field. However, we can discuss the key components typically found in the control or system registers in ARM processors. 

One common control register in ARM architecture is the Control Register (CPSR/SPSR in ARMv7 and PSTATE in ARMv8), which includes various fields controlling the processor's operating mode, exception handling, and other system-related settings.

For a 32-bit ARM architecture, here's a breakdown of some common fields found in the control register:

1. **Mode bits (M[4:0])**: These bits indicate the current processor mode, such as User, Supervisor, Interrupt, Abort, Undefined, etc.

2. **Interrupt disable bit (I)**: This bit controls whether interrupts are enabled or disabled.

3. **Fast Interrupt disable bit (F)**: This bit controls whether fast interrupts (FIQ) are enabled or disabled.

4. **Thumb state bit (T)**: In ARMv7 architecture, this bit indicates whether the processor is in ARM or Thumb state. In ARMv8, this bit is part of the PSTATE register and indicates whether the processor is in AArch32 (32-bit) or AArch64 (64-bit) state.

5. **Overflow (V), Carry (C), Zero (Z), Negative (N)**: These are condition flags set by arithmetic operations and control program flow based on the result of previous instructions.

6. **Endianess bit (E)**: This bit controls the endianness of the processor, indicating whether it operates in little-endian or big-endian mode.

7. **Execution state bits (J, T)**: In ARMv8, additional execution state bits control the processor's execution state, including the Thumb bit (T) for AArch32 mode and the Exception Level bits (EL[3:0]) for specifying the current Exception Level.

The exact breakdown and layout of these fields can vary between ARM architectures and processor implementations. Additionally, ARMv8 architecture introduces more extensive system registers and controls compared to ARMv7, reflecting advancements in functionality and security.
