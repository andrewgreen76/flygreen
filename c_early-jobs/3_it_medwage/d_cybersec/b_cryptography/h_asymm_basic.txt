ASYMMETRIC CIPHER
===================================================================================

 . the encryption key =/= the decryption key
 . a.k.a., public cipher

 . "... each party independently generates its own single private key and derives its own public key."
 . the related private and public keys are bound together as a pair
 . in this two-way communication, the two parties exchange public keys


 . Paul generates a private key A
 -> key A is processed into a public key
 -> the two keys are considered a pair
 . John generates a private key B
 -> key A is processed into a public key
 -> the two keys are considered a pair
 -> Paul has John's public key and John has Paul's
 . "Yes, each user typically stores their private key securely and their public key may be stored locally, on a
    server, or distributed via a certificate or key directory."

Paul	     	    John
-------		    -------
Paul's privkey	    John's privkey
John's pubkey	    Paul's pubkey

 -> Paul would use John's public key to encrypt his own message for John into ciphertext.
 -> John will use his own private key (since the private and public keys are paired in the system) to decrypt the
     message.
