In C, the `DEBUG` macro, along with preprocessor directives like `#ifdef`, `#ifndef`, `#if`, and `#endif`, can be used to conditionally include or exclude code during compilation based on whether a certain macro is defined. This can be useful for adding debugging code that is only included in the compiled binary when a debug mode is enabled.

Here's an example of how you can use these preprocessor directives for debugging:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define DEBUG  // Uncomment this line to enable debug mode

int main() {
    int value = 10;

#ifdef DEBUG
    printf("Debug mode is enabled!\n");
    printf("The value is: %d\n", value);
#endif

    // Rest of the code...

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `DEBUG` macro is defined at the beginning of the code. When the `DEBUG` macro is defined, the code within the `#ifdef DEBUG` and `#endif` directives will be included during compilation. If the `DEBUG` macro is not defined, that code will be excluded.

To enable the debug mode, you can uncomment the `#define DEBUG` line. When the `DEBUG` macro is defined, the debug-related code will be included in the compiled binary and executed.

If you want to conditionally exclude code when a certain macro is defined, you can use `#ifndef` (if not defined) directive instead. For example:

```c
#ifndef DEBUG
    // Code to exclude if DEBUG is defined
#endif
```

Additionally, you can use `#if` and `#endif` to conditionally include or exclude code based on specific conditions. For example:

```c
#if defined(DEBUG) && (VERSION >= 2)
    // Code to include when DEBUG is defined and VERSION is 2 or higher
#endif
```

By strategically placing these preprocessor directives in your code, you can control the inclusion of debugging code or other conditional code based on the defined macros, providing an easy way to enable or disable debug-specific behavior without modifying the code itself.
