Creating a minimal operating system that simply prints "Hello, world" and allows the user to reboot back to a bootloader involves several steps, even if you're using existing tools and components. Assuming that you have the following components ready:

1. **Kernel**: A minimal kernel that can initialize hardware, manage memory, and provide basic I/O functions.

2. **Terminal**: A simple terminal or console interface that can display text.

3. **Linker**: A linker script that specifies how to link your kernel with other components.

4. **Bootloader**: A bootloader that can load and execute your kernel.

5. **Debugger**: Optional, but useful for debugging and development.

To perform the final step of synthesizing everything into a bootable image, you would typically follow these steps:

1. **Compile and Link Your Code**: Use a cross-compiler to compile your kernel and other components. The cross-compiler is necessary because you're targeting a different architecture (the target architecture may be x86, ARM, etc.). Use the linker script to specify how your kernel and other components should be linked together.

2. **Create a Disk Image**: You'll need to create a disk image that includes your compiled kernel, bootloader, and any other necessary files. This disk image should be in a format that your chosen bootloader can understand. Common formats include raw disk images, ISO files, or bootable USB drive images.

3. **Configure the Bootloader**: Configure your bootloader (e.g., GRUB for x86) to load and execute your kernel from the disk image. This configuration involves specifying the path to the kernel, the location in memory where it should be loaded, and any required boot parameters.

4. **Test**: Test your bootable image using a virtual machine or actual hardware (if available). Make sure that it successfully boots and displays the "Hello, world" message.

5. **Create a Bootable Medium**: If you're creating a bootable USB drive or CD/DVD image, use a tool like `dd` (on Linux) or Rufus (on Windows) to write the disk image to the bootable medium.

6. **Distribute**: If you want to distribute your minimal operating system, you can share the bootable medium or disk image with others.

Please note that even a minimal operating system involves several complex steps, and the specific details can vary based on the target architecture, the bootloader you're using, and the development tools you've chosen. Additionally, creating a complete operating system from scratch, even a minimal one, can be a significant undertaking and requires a good understanding of low-level system programming.
