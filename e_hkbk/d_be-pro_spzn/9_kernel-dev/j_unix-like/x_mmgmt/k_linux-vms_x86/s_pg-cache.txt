Linux page cache : 
===================================================================

. retains most-used pages from : 
  . memory-mapped files
  . metadata and files from devices (accessible via read() and write() system calls)
  . process heap pages and process stack pages 
. has its own hash table for storing these entries

Anonymous memory :
. data that resides in RAM almost exclusively
. it may or may not be in the swap space , but it is certainly backed up on the disk
  . ex. : data on the process heap or stack 

===================================================================
Page cleaning (cont'd) :
===================================================================

pdflush threads clean dirty pages : 
. usually done periodically
. but can also occur when there are too many dirty pages in RAM 

===================================================================
(Modified form of) 2Q replacement - Linux eviction policy :
===================================================================

Problem : What if we have a massive file loaded into the page cache ? 
 . LRU would evict pretty much everything else in the page cache to accommodate this behemoth.
 . This can be made worse if pages of this huge file are hardly ever accessed , not really worth their presence in the page cache. 
-> When the file is no longer needed , it gets deleted.
-> What are we left with in the page cache ? 
 . We can isolate a regular heavyweight file from everything else in the cache that is flowing nicely in the inactive queue. 
|
Solution : Isolate and prioritize pages in the cache by their popularity for optimal utilization. 
. the Linux page cache is split between two lists : 
  . upon its first access a page is moved to the inactive queue
  . subsequent accesses put it into the active queue
  . "This keeps the active list to around two-thirds of the entire page cache size."

Linux tracks a page’s cleanliness, similar to VMS, and bulk-writes changes using pdflush, when there are too many dirty pages.

Linux’s page replacement policy tracks which pages are used via the active list.
