The Intel 80386, introduced in 1985, was one of the first Intel microprocessors to incorporate advanced features for interfacing with controllers on the chipset. While it didn't have an integrated memory controller like modern processors, it featured enhancements in its architecture that facilitated communication with external controllers on the chipset.

The 80386 introduced features such as protected mode, virtual memory support, and an improved bus interface compared to its predecessors. These enhancements allowed the 80386 to efficiently interface with controllers on the chipset, including those responsible for memory management, I/O operations, and other system functions.

While the 80386 wasn't the first Intel microprocessor to interface with controllers on the chipset, it marked a significant step forward in Intel's processor architecture, laying the groundwork for future generations of x86 processors with increasingly sophisticated chipset interfaces.

"In the context of computer hardware, 'on the chipset' typically refers to components and controllers integrated directly onto the motherboard's chipset, facilitating communication between the CPU and other system components such as memory, peripherals, and I/O devices."

The Intel 80386 (i386) microprocessor had one integrated controller, which was the memory controller. This integrated memory controller allowed the processor to communicate directly with system memory, improving memory access latency and bandwidth by eliminating the need to go through external controllers on the chipset.
