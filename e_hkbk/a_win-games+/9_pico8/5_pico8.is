What is Pico 8?


Pico-8 is a fantasy console and development platform created by Lexaloffle Games. It is designed to emulate the limitations and style of retro game consoles from the 8-bit era. Pico-8 provides a complete development environment, including a virtual machine, code editor, sprite editor, sound editor, and music tracker, all within a small and constrained system.

With Pico-8, users can create and play games, as well as share them with others. The programming language used in Pico-8 is called "PicoScript," which is similar to the Lua programming language. It has a simple and accessible syntax that allows users to quickly prototype and develop games.

Pico-8 games and projects often have a nostalgic pixel-art style and limited color palette, reminiscent of early console games. The platform encourages creativity and community collaboration, with a focus on small-scale, fun, and expressive game development.

In addition to creating games, Pico-8 has a vibrant community of developers who share their creations, participate in game jams, and collaborate on projects. Pico-8 has gained popularity among indie game developers and enthusiasts for its simplicity, retro charm, and the supportive community that has formed around it.
