Certainly! Here are some recommendations for ARM-based PCBs, microcontrollers, or FPGAs that are capable of generating HDMI signals:

1. **Raspberry Pi**: Raspberry Pi boards, such as the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, are popular choices for HDMI signal generation. They feature powerful ARM processors, ample memory, and HDMI output ports. Additionally, Raspberry Pi boards are well-supported by a large community and have extensive documentation available.

2. **BeagleBoard**: BeagleBoard offers a range of single-board computers suitable for HDMI signal generation. Models like the BeagleBone Black feature ARM Cortex processors, ample memory, and HDMI output capabilities. BeagleBoard products are known for their open-source nature and versatility.

3. **NVIDIA Jetson**: NVIDIA Jetson developer kits, such as the Jetson Nano or Jetson Xavier NX, are powerful options for HDMI signal generation. These kits feature NVIDIA's powerful Tegra processors, ample memory, and support for HDMI output. They are particularly well-suited for applications involving computer vision and AI.

4. **Arduino with FPGA**: Some Arduino-compatible boards, such as the Arduino MKR Vidor 4000, feature FPGA chips alongside ARM microcontrollers. FPGAs offer greater flexibility and parallel processing capabilities, making them suitable for HDMI signal generation with the right programming and hardware configuration.

5. **Xilinx Zynq**: Xilinx Zynq system-on-chip (SoC) devices combine ARM Cortex processors with FPGA fabric on a single chip. Boards like the Zynq UltraScale+ ZCU102 Evaluation Kit provide a powerful platform for HDMI signal generation, leveraging both the ARM cores and FPGA resources.

6. **Intel Cyclone**: Intel Cyclone FPGAs, such as those found in the DE10-Nano development board, offer HDMI output capabilities. These FPGAs feature ARM Cortex processors in addition to programmable logic, providing a versatile platform for HDMI signal generation and other applications.

When choosing a board for HDMI signal generation, consider factors such as processing power, memory capacity, GPIO availability, software support, and community resources. Additionally, ensure that the board meets your specific requirements for voltage compatibility, clock speed, and form factor.
