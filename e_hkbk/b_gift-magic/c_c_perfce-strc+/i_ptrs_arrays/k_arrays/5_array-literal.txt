An array literal, often referred to as an "array initializer," is a syntactic construct used in various programming languages to create and initialize an array with a list of values. It provides a convenient way to define the initial content of an array directly within your code.

The syntax for an array literal typically involves enclosing a comma-separated list of values within square brackets `[ ]`. Here's a basic example in several programming languages:

1. **JavaScript:**
   
   ```javascript
   const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   ```

2. **Python:**

   In Python, you can use a list to achieve similar functionality.

   ```python
   numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   ```

3. **Java:**

   In Java, array literals are used with curly braces `{ }`.

   ```java
   int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
   ```

4. **C++:**

   In C++, you can use an array initializer to initialize an array.

   ```cpp
   int numbers[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
   ```

The array literal allows you to specify the initial values of the array elements in a concise and readable way. Depending on the programming language, the array's type and size may be inferred from the provided values or explicitly declared. Array literals are especially useful when you know the initial data that should populate an array when it's created.

Please note that the syntax for array literals may vary between programming languages, so it's important to refer to the documentation of the specific language you are using for precise details on how to create and initialize arrays using literals in that language.
