... in most cases [a] bootloader will run just fine. However , some BIOSes 
... will tamper with your data if you boot your bootloader from a USB stick.
Now , the reason this happens is because of the BIOS Parameter Block (BPB).
Some BIOSes expect this. While most BIOSes will not corrupt your data and
will work just fine ... , some will actually start filling in information ,
and it's important this doesn't happen. [BPB has] things like number of
sectors per cluster , number of reserved sectors , and so on. [A BIOS can
replace] these numbers in memory with numbers of its own because when we
boot from a USB stick , we're actually doing something known as USB emulation.

We get around this problem by implementing the BIOS Parameter Block. We don't
have to have real values ; it can just be all zeroes and we can just have
a fake one just to get around this problem.
