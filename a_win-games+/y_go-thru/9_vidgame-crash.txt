The 1983 video game crash, also known as the "Atari Shock" or "Video Game Crash of 1983," was a significant downturn in the video game industry caused by market saturation, a flood of low-quality games, and declining consumer confidence. Major factors included the collapse of Atari's dominance due to poorly received games like "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" and "Pac-Man," as well as intense competition from home computers and new gaming platforms. The crash led to a sharp decline in video game sales and the bankruptcy of several companies, but it eventually paved the way for a revitalized industry, including the rise of Nintendo in the mid-1980s.
