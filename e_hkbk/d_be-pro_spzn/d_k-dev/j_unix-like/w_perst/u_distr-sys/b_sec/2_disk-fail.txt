DISK FAILURE TYPES - CAUSES AND DEGREES OF SEVERITY 
======================================================================================


Latent-sector error :
 |
 |
 . INACCESSIBLE sectors 
 . damage by a head crash or cosmic rays
 |
 . data corruption awareness : NOT IMMEDIATELY NOTICEABLE
 |
 . expected solution : disk recovery 
    . LSE's can be fixed by disk check utilities
       . chkdsk on Windows
       . fsck on Linux
       . otherwise you'd want to have a JFS



Block corruption : 
  |
  |
 (1) caused by physical damage  
 (2) caused by data transfer via a faulty bus 
  |
  . data corruption awareness : immediately noticeable
  . expected solution : disk recovery  



Fail-stop (recap) :
 |
 |
 . a way of responding to disk damage or corruption 
 . THE DISK IS RULED USELESS at the slightest issue 
 |
 . data corruption awareness : immediately noticeable
 . expected solution : DISK REPLACEMENT
