FORMAL RELATIONSHIP IN APPLIED COMPUTER SCIENCE 
===================================================================================

 . between data types and operations 
 . how one item (token) makes an impact on another item 
 . how one item determines something about another item 
 . what is true(/false) about the two items 


Typical example :
|
"
An example of a formal relationship in applied computer science is the RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DATA TYPES AND OPERATIONS in programming languages, where specific types dictate the allowable operations (e.g., integers can be added or multiplied, while strings can be concatenated), ensuring that programs adhere to defined rules and behaviors.
"


Other examples :
|
"
While the relationship between data types and operations is a prominent example, formal relationships can also be seen in areas like database schemas and integrity constraints, where the structure and rules governing data relationships ensure consistency and validity within a database system.

===================================================================================
STRUCTURE 
===================================================================================

 .

There are two different kinds of structures : mathematical and logical. 


===================================================================================
MATHEMATICAL STRUCTURE 
===================================================================================

 . 


===================================================================================
FORMAL SYMBOL 
===================================================================================

 . a character or string as a recognized way of communicating a (mathematical or
   logical) object or concept 


Formal symbols in prepositional logic :

Propositional Variables: P,Q,R,…P,Q,R,… (representing statements)
Negation: ¬¬ (not)
Conjunction: ∧∧ (and)
Disjunction: ∨∨ (or)
Implication: →→ (implies)
Biconditional: ↔↔ (if and only if)
Truth: ⊤ (true)
Falsity: ⊥ (false)


===================================================================================
FORMAL LANGUAGE 
===================================================================================

 . a comprehensive collection of all formal symbols for communicating
   problem-solving ideas

"
... there are many formal languages, each designed for specific purposes, such as programming languages, mathematical logic, and formal specification languages. Each has its own set of symbols and rules tailored to the needs of its domain.
