"
Boron-doped (p-type) silicon conducts electricity primarily via positive-charge-carrying holes with hole mobility
  around 450–500 cm²/V·s, while phosphorus-doped (n-type) silicon conducts primarily via negative electrons with
  higher electron mobility around 1350–1500 cm²/V·s, making n-type silicon significantly more conductive for the
  same doping concentration.
