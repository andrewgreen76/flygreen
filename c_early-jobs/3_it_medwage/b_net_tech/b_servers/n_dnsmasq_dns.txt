dnsmasq
===================================================================================

 . a utility for regulating services essential to your IT infrastructure
 . across DNS, DHCP, TFTP, and PXE
 . clearly a centralizing solution
 |
 . provides cache for DNS queries
 => caches external DNS server responses
 |
 $ sudo apt install dnsmasq   # ... , the service is INSTALLED and it's up and RUNNING.
 |
 . "In regular mode, dnsmasq runs silently as a background daemon with minimal logging to the system log, handling
 |  DNS queries, DHCP leases, and caching efficiently without the verbose output or performance overhead of debug
 |  mode."
 |
 $ sudo service dnsmasq stop
 $ sudo dnsmasq -dq		      # debug mode, log our queries
 $ sudo dnsmasq -d -q -H [host file]    # Consider this additional file I specified and resolve the hostnames
   		      	       		# listed in that file.


dig:
 |
 . "... receives all requested DNS resource records directly from the queried DNS server (or recursive resolver)
 |  in a single response ... ."
 |
 . dnsmasq is to run in one shell session (console), while dig is to be run in a different session. 
 |
 $ dig [web-address] @[hostname]
 $ dig @[IP_address] [domain/label]    # queries the DNS server at the IP address for resrouce record of the
       		     		       # domain/label.
