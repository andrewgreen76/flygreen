`bless` is a command-line utility primarily used on macOS to manage bootable disks. It can set a specified volume as the boot disk, making it the default option for startup. You can use it to bless a disk or partition, typically in conjunction with creating bootable USB drives or managing system boot settings. For example:

```bash
sudo bless --mount /Volumes/YourVolumeName --setBoot
```

This command would set the specified volume as the boot disk.
