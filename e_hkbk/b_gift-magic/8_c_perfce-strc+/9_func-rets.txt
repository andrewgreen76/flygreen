When a function returns -1, it typically indicates that an error or exceptional condition has occurred. In many programming languages and conventions, negative return values are often used to signal failure or errors, while non-negative values (including zero) may indicate success or a non-error condition.

Here are some common scenarios where a function might return -1 to indicate an error:

1. **File I/O Functions:**
   - Functions like `open`, `read`, `write`, and `close` in C and other languages may return -1 to signal an error during file operations. For example, `open` might return -1 if it fails to open a file.

2. **Search Functions:**
   - Functions that search for an element in an array, list, or other data structure may return -1 to indicate that the element was not found.

3. **Memory Allocation Functions:**
   - Functions like `malloc` in C may return -1 (or `NULL` in the case of pointers) to indicate a failure to allocate memory.

4. **System Calls:**
   - Various system calls or library functions in operating systems may return -1 to indicate an error condition. For example, the `socket` function in networking programming may return -1 on failure.

5. **Custom Functions:**
   - In your own functions, you might choose to use -1 to indicate errors or exceptional conditions, especially if there's a need to distinguish between different failure modes.

It's important to check the documentation or error-handling conventions of the specific function you're using to understand the meaning of a -1 return value. Additionally, many programming languages provide a way to obtain more detailed error information, such as through global variables (e.g., `errno` in C) or exceptions. Proper error handling should be implemented to handle and diagnose the specific error conditions.
