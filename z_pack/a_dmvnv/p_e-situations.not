Brakes fail :
- use E-brake



Wet brakes :
- drive slow, apply the brakes until the action is normal



Sticky gas pedal :
1) press hard and fast on gas , release
2) neutral -> brakes -> pull off the highway and stop
   - do NOT place into "park".



Blowout :
- firm grip on the wheel
- ease off the gas pedal , do NOT use the brakes
- look for a safe place , pull over
- under control , slowed down => use brakes to stop
- 4-way flash
