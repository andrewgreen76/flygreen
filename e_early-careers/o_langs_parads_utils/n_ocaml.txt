The core subset of Rust is written ... with some low-level parts relying on LLVM and a minimal amount of assembly. ... Rust's core subset is not written in OCaml, though LLVM, which Rust relies on, was originally developed using OCaml.

The first Rust compiler was written in OCaml (and in fact it is one of the languages that influenced Rust). Only a couple of years later did a Rust compiler get written in rust itself. Both existed in parallel for a bit before the OCaml based compiler got deleted. Rustc back then was a lot buggier than it is right now.
