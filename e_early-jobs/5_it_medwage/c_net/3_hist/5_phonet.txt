The telephone
 . invented in 1876 by Alexander Graham Bell 


PUBLIC SWITCHED TELEPHONE NETWORK (PSTN) : 
 . a.k.a. Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) 
 . this old telephone connection infrastructure that was leveraged to connect computers at long distances
     in the late 1970s


Analog phone lines to transmit data : 
 . “Phone lines were first used to transmit data by converting digital signals into audio tones using modems,
    which allowed computers to communicate over the existing analog telephone network.”
Modem :
 . “The first modem was invented in 1958 by Bell Labs to transmit digital data over telephone lines for the U.S.
    Air Force’s SAGE air-defense system.”


Dial-up connection : 
 . uses POTS to TRANSFER DATA BY DIALING A PHONE NUMBER
 . A computer's digital signals would be converted to analog before having been sent over phone lines with a modem.
 . The recipient modem would convert the incoming analog signal back to digital and feed it to the local computer.
 . “The first dial-up network was realized in 1965 with the creation of the Dartmouth Time-Sharing System (DTSS),
   which allowed remote computer access via telephone lines and modems.”
