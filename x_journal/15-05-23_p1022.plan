    So excited about learning Linux kernel development. Just crawling out of my skin.
The feeling of getting closer to the hardware. So much to learn about UART ports, SCI,
process scheduling, memory management, etc. Already ordered some books. Shelled out
quite a bit. I want to start off super-small, understand thoroughly what a kernel is,
how it works, how to cook up a dumb kernel. But then there is also learning how to fix
bugs like a pro, to an extent where I can impress myself and others. My intuitions may
be wrong about where to start, but I think it should be totally worth it regardless of
the direction I take. Seems like Unity and C# will have to wait; conquering hardware,
BIOS, and operating system build is enough of a game for me. Can't have everything,
sadly.

    I also forgot to point out that, though I do find subjects around the kernel, such
as the use of a Raspberry Pi SBC, perhaps it would be best if I stay focused on just
one topic, continue honing my C programming skills, re-learning the usefulness of pointers
and references and maybe some other things.
