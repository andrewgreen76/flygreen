WHAT IS AN EXCEPTION :
========================================================================================

 . a condition/event the hardware or the system has to respond to

"
1. **Integer Overflow**: An arithmetic operation produces a value exceeding the maximum representable value for the given data type.
2. **Divide by Zero**: Attempting to divide a number by zero.
3. **Null Pointer Dereference**: Accessing memory through a null pointer.
4. **Segmentation Fault**: Accessing memory outside of the allocated range.
5. **Stack Overflow**: Exceeding the stack size limit, typically due to deep or infinite recursion.
6. **Arithmetic Underflow**: An arithmetic operation results in a number too small to be represented.
7. **Buffer Overflow**: Writing data beyond the boundaries of allocated memory.
8. **Access Violation**: Attempting to read or write to a restricted area of memory.
9. **Invalid Opcode**: Executing an instruction that the processor does not recognize.
10. **Page Fault**: Accessing a page of memory that is not currently mapped to the virtual address space.
11. **Bus Error**: A fault resulting from an invalid physical address or other memory access issues.
12. **Floating Point Exception**: Errors in floating-point arithmetic, such as overflow, underflow, division by zero, or invalid operations.
13. **Illegal Instruction**: Attempting to execute an instruction that is not allowed.
14. **Alignment Fault**: Accessing data that is not properly aligned in memory.
15. **Timeout**: An operation exceeds the allowed time limit.
16. **Privileged Instruction**: Attempting to execute an instruction that is reserved for the operating system or other privileged code.
17. **Hardware Failure**: Issues due to hardware malfunction.
18. **I/O Error**: Errors during input/output operations, such as disk read/write failures.
19. **Segmentation Fault**: Accessing memory in a way that is disallowed by the operating system (common in C/C++ programming).

 . overflow - an attempt to store a number that is too large for a register/memory address 
 . underflow - an attempt to store a number that is too small for a register/memory address
   (typically occurring in floating-point arithmetic)

WHAT IS AN INTERRUPT :
========================================================================================


A signal triggered by an exception (an event) and informing the hardware or the system
that the exception must be handled.

For every exception there should be an interrupt and a way to handle it - an interrupt handler,
a.k.a. an ISR (an interrupt service routine). 

Occurrence	-> trigger	-> response 
Event     	   interrupt  	   handling
Exception
Division by zero
Value won't fit
Button press
Illegal memory access


========================================================================================
HARDWARE INTERRUPT :
========================================================================================


 . asynchronous (UNEXPECTED , independent external event/intervention)
   . can occur at any time , even in the middle of instruction execution 
 . so called because it does not need software for it to occur 


 . triggered by : 
   . a peripheral (I/O) : button press , NIC , etc.  
   . a timer
   . debug module
 -> INTERRUPT
 -> context switching (w/ PCB) 
 -> ISR 


========================================================================================
SOFTWARE INTERRUPT = TRAP :
========================================================================================


 . synchronous - can only occur after completion of instruction execution  
 . occurs in the control unit/register 
 . triggered by (during process execution) : 
   . user process' request for OS service 
   . an error (e.g., overflow , DIV/0 , illegal memory access) 
   . suspicious process behavior (OS trap for the kernel mode) 
   . device driver interaction 
   . an instruction (e.g., system call)
 -> OS service request / exception 
 -> OS TRAP 
 -> context switching (w/ PCB) 
 -> kernel mode + trap handler  


=> The kernel cannot do its job without traps.
