WAN OPTIMIZATION METHODS
===================================================================================

Compression of files: 
 . to help with traffic
 . sender and recipient will need an app for the same set of compression and decompression algorithms 
 . there are many encoding and decoding algorithms out there


Deduplication: 
 . WAN converts every redundant copy of a file into a pointer to that file
 => more efficient data backups 
 => more efficient data recovery
 . WAN disk hardware is expensive 


Protocol optimization: 
 . makes networking protocols more efficient for resource-intensive applications that need more bandwidth
   for better performance 


Local caching.
 . SOME products allow for caching shared files. 


Traffic shaping - transmission optimizations: 
 . bandwidth throttling: managing excessive traffic
 . rate limiting: capping the bandwidth 
 . complex algorithms: organizing and prioritizing data in the traffic
