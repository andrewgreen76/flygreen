INTEL 4004 - INCLUSIONS AND INNOVATIONS : 
========================================================================================

 . world's first microprocessor 

========================================================================================
INTEL 4004 - OVERVIEW : 
========================================================================================

 . released in 1971



Had the following :
 |
 . clock
 . PC/IP width : 12 bits 
 . control logic (IR , stepper , decoder) 
 . 16 general-purpose registers (R0-R15) :
   . 4 bits 
 . ALU : 4-bit
 . MAR : 12 bits
 . MDR : 4 bits 
 |
 . data bus width : 4 bits
 . address bus width : 4 bits
 . address width : 12 bits (past bus limits as an address can be multiplexed)
 |
 . "The Intel 4004 processor, despite having a 4-bit address width, was often used
 |  in systems with bank-switching techniques that allowed it to access larger amounts
 |  of memory. In practice, it could address up to 4 KB (4096 bytes) of memory."
 |
 => addressable memory range : 2^(12 bits) = 4K



Lacked the following :
 | 
 . control registers
 . controllers
 . chipset
 . BIU / segment registers

In the Intel 4004 microprocessor, control signals were not retained in dedicated control registers as in modern processors. Instead, the microinstructions stored in ROM were decoded and executed within the same clock cycle, effectively dispatching control signals to the various components of the CPU as needed.

The microinstructions encoded in ROM determined the sequence of operations required to execute each machine instruction. These microinstructions controlled the ALU, memory access, and other functional units within the processor, orchestrating their operation to execute instructions.

While the 4004 did not have the same level of complexity or architectural features as modern processors, its approach to control signal management was sufficient for its intended purpose and contributed to its role as one of the earliest microprocessors.

The nomenclature "4004" in "Intel 4004" refers to the model number of the microprocessor. Here's a breakdown of the origin of this model number:

1. **4**: The first digit, "4," indicates that the microprocessor was designed as part of Intel's fourth-generation products. At the time of its development in the early 1970s, Intel was primarily focused on memory products, such as the 1101 and 1103 dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) chips. The "4" in the model number signifies that the 4004 was part of Intel's fourth-generation product line.

2. **004**: The remaining three digits, "004," were chosen sequentially for product identification within the fourth-generation series. The "004" designation doesn't have a specific meaning beyond serving as a unique identifier for the microprocessor within Intel's product lineup.

Combining these elements, the model number "4004" was assigned to the Intel microprocessor as part of Intel's fourth-generation product series, with "004" indicating its sequential designation within that series.

The Intel 4004 microprocessor, introduced in 1971, was a pioneering achievement as the world's first commercially available microprocessor. It marked a significant milestone in the history of computing and laid the groundwork for the development of modern microprocessors.
