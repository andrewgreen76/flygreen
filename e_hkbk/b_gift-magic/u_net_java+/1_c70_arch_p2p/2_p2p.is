Is P2P a protocol or something else?

P2P (peer-to-peer) refers to a networking architecture or paradigm rather than a specific protocol. It is a decentralized approach where participants in a network, referred to as peers, can communicate and interact with each other directly, without relying on a central server or authority.

P2P networks can utilize various protocols and technologies to enable peer communication and resource sharing. Some commonly used protocols and technologies in P2P networking include:

    BitTorrent: A protocol designed for efficient file sharing, where files are divided into small pieces and distributed among peers. Peers collaborate to download and upload pieces from and to each other.

    Distributed Hash Tables (DHT): DHTs are a distributed data structure used for decentralized indexing and lookup in P2P networks. They enable peers to locate resources and information without relying on a central index or directory.

    WebRTC: Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) is a technology that enables real-time peer-to-peer communication, such as video calls and data sharing, directly between web browsers without the need for intermediaries.

    Blockchain: Blockchain technology, known for powering cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, utilizes a P2P network for validating and maintaining a decentralized ledger of transactions. Peers in the network collectively participate in verifying and adding new transactions to the blockchain.

It's important to note that P2P can be implemented using various protocols and technologies, and the choice of protocol depends on the specific requirements and use case of the P2P application or network. The P2P paradigm itself focuses on the direct communication and collaboration between peers, allowing them to act as both consumers and providers of resources and services.
