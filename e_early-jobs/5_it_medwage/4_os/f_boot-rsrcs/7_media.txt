VIA A NETWORK (LAN)
===================================================================================

 . "PXE (Preboot Execution Environment) is a protocol that allows a computer to boot an operating system
    over a network instead of from local storage."
    
 . "In a LAN environment , a PXE server (or TFTP/boot server") needs to house the OS image for the target
    machine to load into RAM."

 . You can enable and set up PXE through BIOS. 


===================================================================================
VIA CLOUD
===================================================================================

 . "In a cloud environment, a hypervisor or virtual machine manager needs to house the OS image, typically
      STORED ON A NETWORKED STORAGE SYSTEM LIKE A SAN OR NAS, which the target machine accesses to load the
      operating system into RAM during the boot process."
 . "A SAN (Storage Area Network) is a high-speed, dedicated network that provides block-level storage access
     to multiple servers, often used in enterprise environments, while a NAS (Network Attached Storage) is a
     file-level storage device connected to a network, offering simpler access for sharing and backup across
     devices."
