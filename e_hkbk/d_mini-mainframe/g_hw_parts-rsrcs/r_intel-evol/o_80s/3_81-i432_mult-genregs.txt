The first Intel microprocessor to feature multiple ALUs and multiple sets of general-purpose registers was the Intel iAPX 432, introduced in the early 1980s. 

The Intel iAPX 432 was a highly ambitious processor architecture designed for high-level programming languages and sophisticated operating systems. It featured a unique object-based architecture and included multiple ALUs and register sets to support advanced features such as object-oriented programming, hardware-based garbage collection, and built-in support for parallelism.

However, the iAPX 432 faced numerous challenges and complexities in its design, and it did not achieve widespread adoption. Despite its innovative features, the architecture was considered complex and expensive to implement, and it did not offer the performance improvements over existing architectures that Intel had hoped for.

As a result, the iAPX 432 architecture was not commercially successful, and Intel shifted its focus to other processor designs, such as the x86 architecture, which eventually became the dominant architecture in the industry.
