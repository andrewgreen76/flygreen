`dup3()` is a system call in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems that duplicates an open file descriptor. It is similar to `dup2()`, but it provides additional options and is more flexible.

Here is the prototype of the `dup3()` system call:

```c
int dup3(int oldfd, int newfd, int flags);
```

- `oldfd`: The file descriptor to be duplicated.
- `newfd`: The file descriptor to be used as the duplicate.
- `flags`: Additional flags that can modify the behavior. It can include `O_CLOEXEC` to set the close-on-exec flag.

The main difference between `dup2()` and `dup3()` is the ability to specify additional flags with `dup3()`. The `O_CLOEXEC` flag, for example, allows you to set the close-on-exec flag for the new file descriptor in an atomic operation.

Here's an example of using `dup3()`:

```c
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    int oldfd = open("example.txt", O_RDONLY);
    if (oldfd == -1) {
        perror("open");
        return 1;
    }

    int newfd = dup(oldfd);
    if (newfd == -1) {
        perror("dup");
        close(oldfd);
        return 1;
    }

    // Use newfd as needed...

    close(oldfd);
    close(newfd);

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `dup3()` is not used, but `dup()` is used to duplicate an open file descriptor. `dup3()` becomes more relevant when additional flags need to be set for the new file descriptor.
