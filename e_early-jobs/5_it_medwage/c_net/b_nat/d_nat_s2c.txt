HOW NAT HANDLES MASSIVE SERVER-TO-CLIENT TRAFFIC 
===================================================================================

***SCENARIO*** : The HTTPS webserver sends a response to the client via the client's gateway.
-> "The server will send the response **from its system port 443** toward the gateway."
-> "The gateway will receive the packet on the [same] external port it assigned for the outgoing connection
      to the server."
->  The gateway will use NAT, reusing the mapping of the external port to the internal port and the mapping
      of ACTSRC to SSNI, and thus feed the packet through its own client-side networking interface to the
      intended recipient client on the ephemeral port they both shared in the first place. Again, port
      preservation. 


Reminder : 
 . INTERNAL PORT : "the original source port on the client side that the gateway tracks for NAT mapping"
 . EXTERNAL PORT : "the port assigned by the gateway for the outgoing connection toward the server"
