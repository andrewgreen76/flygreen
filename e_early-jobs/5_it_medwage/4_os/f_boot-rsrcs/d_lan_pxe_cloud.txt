DOWNLOADING THE OS IMAGE - VIA A NETWORK (LAN)
===================================================================================

 . Enable and set up PXE (Preboot Execution Environment) through BIOS. 
    . PXE - a client-server system/interface (with a specification) implemented with hardware and software ,
        aiming to allow for retrieving OS booting resources remotely.
 -> the target machine needs to download the NBP (network bootstrap system) via a DHCP/TFTP protocol
      (in a LAN environment)
 -> uses NBP to download the OS boot files (the kernel and the initial filesystem) from the PXE BOOT SERVER 


Think about that : Your computer doesn't even need an OS to do networking !

DOWNLOADING THE OS IMAGE - VIA CLOUD
===================================================================================

 . "In a cloud environment, a hypervisor or virtual machine manager needs to house the OS image, typically
      STORED ON A NETWORKED STORAGE SYSTEM LIKE A SAN OR NAS, which the target machine accesses to load the
      operating system into RAM during the boot process."
 . "A SAN (Storage Area Network) is a high-speed, dedicated network that provides block-level storage access
     to multiple servers, often used in enterprise environments, while a NAS (Network Attached Storage) is a
     file-level storage device connected to a network, offering simpler access for sharing and backup across
     devices."
