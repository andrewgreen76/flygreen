IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) was first officially deployed in 1986. The initial version of IMAP, known as IMAP1, was introduced in RFC 1064. It was designed as a protocol for accessing and managing email messages stored on a remote mail server.

Over time, IMAP has gone through various revisions and updates to enhance its functionality and security. IMAP2 was defined in RFC 1176 in 1990, followed by IMAP2bis in RFC 1176 in 1993. The most widely used version of IMAP is IMAP4, which was introduced in RFC 1730 in 1994 and later refined in RFC 3501 in 2003.

IMAP4 introduced several significant improvements and features, including support for server-side mailbox management, message searching capabilities, message flags, and folder hierarchy. It allowed users to access their email messages from multiple devices while keeping messages synchronized with the server.

Since its deployment, IMAP has become a widely adopted protocol for email retrieval and management, particularly in environments where users require access to their email messages from various devices while maintaining server-side storage and synchronization.
