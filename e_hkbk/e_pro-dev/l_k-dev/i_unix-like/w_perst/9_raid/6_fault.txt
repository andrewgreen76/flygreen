Fault :
 . a cause for potential malfunctioning
 . ex. : wear-and-tear , physical defects , electrical failures 


Fault tolerance :
 . basically , the ability to WORK AROUND a fault 
 . persistence and resilience in spite of faults 
 + redundancy - for backup 
 + QUICK RESPONSE with error checking and correction


Fault model :
 . a design with the aim of developing a RAID system capable of recovering from certain kinds of faults


Fail-stop :
 . the model assumes that a disk is either 100% usable or useless , nothing in the middle ... 
 . ... but the rest of the disks may still function and allow the drive to continue operating 
 . the RAID controller or software constantly monitors for disk failure (fault detection)
