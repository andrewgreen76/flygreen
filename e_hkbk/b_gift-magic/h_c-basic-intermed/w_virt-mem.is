What is virtual memory?
ChatGPT

Virtual memory is a memory management technique used by operating systems to provide an illusion of a larger memory space than physically available in the system. It allows programs to operate on a larger address space than the actual physical memory by using a combination of physical memory (RAM) and disk storage.

In virtual memory, each process has its own virtual address space, which is divided into pages. The mapping between the virtual pages and physical memory is managed by the operating system. When a process accesses a virtual memory address, the operating system translates it to a corresponding physical memory address.

Key concepts related to virtual memory include:

    Virtual Address Space: The address space seen by a process, which includes the entire range of addresses the process can access. Each process has its own separate virtual address space.

    Pages: The virtual address space is divided into fixed-size pages. The size of a page is determined by the operating system and is typically 4KB or 4MB.

    Page Table: The operating system maintains a data structure called the page table for each process. It maps the virtual pages to their corresponding physical memory locations.

    Page Fault: When a process tries to access a virtual page that is not currently in physical memory, a page fault occurs. The operating system handles the page fault by fetching the required page from disk into physical memory.

    Demand Paging: Virtual memory employs a technique called demand paging, where only the required pages are loaded into physical memory as needed. This allows efficient use of memory resources and enables running processes larger than available physical memory.

    Swap Space: The disk space reserved for storing pages that are not currently in physical memory is called the swap space. It acts as an extension to physical memory, allowing infrequently accessed pages to be swapped between disk and memory.

Virtual memory provides several advantages, including the ability to run larger programs, efficient memory management, memory protection, and isolation between processes. It enables the operating system to make efficient use of physical memory resources and allows multiple processes to run concurrently without interfering with each other's memory.
