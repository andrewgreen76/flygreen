To automate the reconnection to a specific network in Ubuntu whenever connectivity is lost, you can use a combination of `nmcli` commands and possibly a script that periodically checks and reconnects if needed. Hereâ€™s a basic approach using a script:

1. **Identify Network Details**:
   First, you need to know the SSID (network name) or UUID of the network you want to reconnect to. You can find this information using `nmcli`.

   ```bash
   nmcli connection show
   ```

   This will list all the connections along with their UUIDs and other details.

2. **Create a Bash Script**:
   Open your favorite text editor and create a Bash script, for example, `auto_reconnect.sh`.

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   # Replace 'YOUR_CONNECTION_NAME' with the name of your network connection
   CONNECTION_NAME="YOUR_CONNECTION_NAME"

   # Check if the connection is active
   nmcli connection show --active | grep "$CONNECTION_NAME" > /dev/null

   if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
       echo "Connection lost. Reconnecting..."
       nmcli connection up "$CONNECTION_NAME"
   else
       echo "Connection is already active."
   fi
   ```

   - Replace `YOUR_CONNECTION_NAME` with the actual name or UUID of your network connection.

3. **Make the Script Executable**:
   Save the script and make it executable.

   ```bash
   chmod +x auto_reconnect.sh
   ```

4. **Run the Script Automatically**:
   To run this script periodically, you can use `cron` or `systemd` timers:

   - **Using `cron`**: Open crontab for editing with `crontab -e` and add a line like:

     ```cron
     * * * * * /path/to/auto_reconnect.sh >/dev/null 2>&1
     ```

     This runs the script every minute. Adjust the timing as needed.

   - **Using `systemd` timer** (for more control and flexibility):

     Create a systemd service and timer. First, create a service file (`auto_reconnect.service`):

     ```ini
     [Unit]
     Description=Auto Reconnect to WiFi Service

     [Service]
     Type=oneshot
     ExecStart=/path/to/auto_reconnect.sh
     ```

     Then, create a timer file (`auto_reconnect.timer`):

     ```ini
     [Unit]
     Description=Run Auto Reconnect to WiFi every minute

     [Timer]
     OnBootSec=1min
     OnUnitActiveSec=1min
     Unit=auto_reconnect.service

     [Install]
     WantedBy=multi-user.target
     ```

     Enable and start the timer:

     ```bash
     sudo systemctl enable auto_reconnect.timer
     sudo systemctl start auto_reconnect.timer
     ```

     This setup will run the script every minute.

### Notes:
- Replace `/path/to/auto_reconnect.sh` with the actual path where you saved the `auto_reconnect.sh` script.
- Adjust the script and timing according to your specific requirements and network setup.
- Ensure that the script and commands are run with appropriate permissions and in a secure manner, especially if dealing with sensitive network information.
  
This approach ensures that Ubuntu automatically attempts to reconnect to your specified network whenever the connection is lost.
