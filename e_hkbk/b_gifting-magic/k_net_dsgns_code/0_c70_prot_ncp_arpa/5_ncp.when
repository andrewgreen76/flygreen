The Network Control Program (NCP) was not launched on a specific date. NCP was developed as part of the ARPANET project, which began in the late 1960s and continued into the 1970s.

The development and deployment of NCP for the ARPANET network occurred gradually over time as the network infrastructure and protocols were being established. The early versions of NCP were implemented and refined as the network evolved and expanded.

While it is challenging to pinpoint an exact "official launch" date for NCP, the initial deployment of the ARPANET, which utilized NCP as the primary protocol for communication between host computers, took place in 1969. This marked a significant milestone in the development of computer networking and the birth of the ARPANET.

NCP underwent several revisions and refinements as the ARPANET project progressed, incorporating improvements in reliability, efficiency, and functionality. However, NCP was eventually superseded by the TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) suite of protocols, which became the standard for internet communication.

It's worth noting that the transition from NCP to TCP/IP occurred over a period of time, starting in the late 1970s and continuing through the 1980s. TCP/IP gradually replaced NCP as the primary protocol suite for the evolving internet.
