WHEN WOULD I WANT TO USE "STATIC" ? 
========================================================================================

 . When wishing to prohibit outside use of the variable/function.
   . i.e. , meant for the original programmer and no other developer
   
 . It would probably not make much sense to use "static" when working on an exclusively
   solo project. 


========================================================================================
========================================================================================
========================================================================================

Static variable : 
 . will not die until the end of the program
 . created anywhere within the file
 . inaccessible at runtime 


========================================================================================

Static variable :
 . If it is to have the same value throughout its lifetime , but it can't be const ,
   let it be static.

Static function :
 . limited access

Static global variable :
 . limited access 


========================================================================================

"
In C, the `static` keyword has several uses depending on its context:

1. **Static Variables**: When used inside a function, it makes a variable retain its value between function calls.
2. **Static Functions**: Restricts the scope of the function to the file where it is defined, making it inaccessible from other files.
3. **Static Global Variables**: Limits the scope of a global variable to the file where it is defined, preventing access from other files.
