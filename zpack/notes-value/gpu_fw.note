Yes, GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) have their own firmware.

The firmware is a type of software that is embedded in hardware devices such as GPUs. It provides low-level control over the device's hardware and serves as a bridge between the hardware and the higher-level software that runs on top of it.

The firmware in a GPU is responsible for controlling various functions of the device, such as memory management, power management, and communication with the system's CPU. It is typically stored in non-volatile memory on the GPU and is loaded into the device's volatile memory at boot time.

The firmware in GPUs can be updated or modified by the manufacturer or user to improve performance, fix bugs, or add new features. These updates are often provided as firmware patches or updates from the manufacturer.
