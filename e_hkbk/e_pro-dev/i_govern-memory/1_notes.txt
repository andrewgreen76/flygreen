How does this one come up with a memory address ?
Is it a relative memory address ? (Memory protection ?)
Is it the kernel that comes up with the absolute memory address ?
  How does it map the abs_mem_addr to rel_mem_addr ?


Stack vs. heap :
 |
 . [stack] x [var_init in ds (not ss) IN ASSEMBLY , bind to label]
 |  . the compiler generates the assembly code to do that
 |
 . [heap] x [ malloc() , free() ]
    . the compiler generates the assembly code to do that
