It is clear that IQ correlates to wealth only on the negative end; that is to say if you have a quite low IQ you're pretty much doomed not to make very much money unfortunately.

But for every high IQ genius who makes millions with some great software company or becomes a brain surgeon, there are 5 with anxiety disorders and another 5 who are too distractible to ever really achieve anything. People skills and grit are far more important.
