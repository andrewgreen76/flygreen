STORAGE DRIVE - CAVEAT 
===================================================================================

Very frequently we will hear the word "disk" in place of "storage drive". Personally , I do not recommend using
  "hard drive" in its place as , technically speaking , SSD's are not HDD's , and using the term "hard drive"
  may create some confusion for students.
