Why : the AND gate can be used for
 - logic purposes
 - re-routing a current



- In an AND gate the switches/transistors are in a series.

Assuming a minimum of two inputs/switches : 
- One switch per pair of transistors (pmos and nmos).
- 6+ transistors
  = 2 two transistors / switch
  + 2 two transistors / switch
  + 2 two transistors / inverter

- Design for modifier keys : [left, right] x [Shift, Ctrl, Alt, Meta (fn, Win) ]
  - ... although in reality, the key input on the board is supposed to be sequenced.
