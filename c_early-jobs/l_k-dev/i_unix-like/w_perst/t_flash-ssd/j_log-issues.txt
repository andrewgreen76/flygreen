ISSUES WITH TRADITIONAL LOG STRUCTURING :
===================================================================================

 - avoiding overwriting (to curtal memory cell wear) means writing to erased blocks/pages
    - DEAD BLOCKS : obsolete copies of the same thing are preserved
    + but a garbage collector will come around
    
 - in-memory mapping tables are expensive
    . the larger the device , the larger the table will have to be
    
 - lack of economy :
    . 1 piece of data takes up too much storage space
    . this really adds up when we attempt to store huge files
    . makes FTL slow
