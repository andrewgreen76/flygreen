BJT vs. MOSFET
===================================================================================

"
... BJTs are current-controlled (base current turns it on) while MOSFETs are voltage-controlled (gate-source voltage
  turns it on), so the biasing and drive circuitry are completely different — a direct pin-for-pin replacement almost
  always fails.
