Yes, an emulator can retain changes made within the simulated system, including created files, downloaded images, and other modifications. Emulators, such as Android emulators or gaming console emulators, typically provide storage mechanisms to save and persist changes made within the emulated environment.

For example, in the case of an Android emulator, it creates a virtual Android device that emulates the behavior of a physical Android device. The emulator usually provides a virtual SD card or emulated internal storage where files, images, and other data can be saved. When you create files or download images within the emulated Android environment, those changes are typically stored within the emulator's storage system.

Similarly, gaming console emulators often provide functionality to save game progress and user data. Emulated consoles may have virtual memory cards or other storage mechanisms that mimic the original console's ability to save game data.

These storage mechanisms within emulators allow for the persistence of changes made within the emulated system. When you exit the emulator and later restart it, you can typically resume from where you left off, and your created files, downloaded images, saved games, and other modifications will still be accessible within the emulated environment.

It's worth noting that the persistence of changes in an emulator may depend on its specific configuration and settings. Some emulators offer options to save state or provide separate storage for specific types of data, while others may simulate read-only environments. The specific behavior can vary depending on the emulator you are using and its settings.
