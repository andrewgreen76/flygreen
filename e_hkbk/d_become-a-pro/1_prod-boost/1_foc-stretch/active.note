If you spend long periods of time in a seated position and want to focus on exercises for your bottom and legs, there are several exercises you can incorporate into your routine. It's important to note that these exercises are intended to supplement an overall active lifestyle and should not replace regular movement and standing breaks throughout the day. Here are some exercises to consider:

    Seated Leg Extensions: Sit upright in a chair and extend one leg in front of you. Hold for a few seconds, then lower it back down. Repeat for a set of 10-15 repetitions on each leg. This exercise targets your quadriceps (front of the thighs).

    Seated Glute Squeezes: While seated, squeeze your glutes (buttocks) tightly together and hold for a few seconds. Release and repeat for a set of 10-15 repetitions. This exercise helps engage and activate your glute muscles.

    Seated Marching: Sit with your feet flat on the ground, hip-width apart. Lift one foot off the ground and bring your knee up toward your chest. Lower it down and repeat with the opposite leg. Aim for a set of 10-15 repetitions on each leg. This exercise targets your hip flexors and engages your lower abs.

    Seated Calf Raises: Sit with your feet flat on the ground. Raise your heels off the floor as high as you can, feeling the contraction in your calves. Lower your heels back down and repeat for a set of 10-15 repetitions. This exercise targets your calf muscles.

    Seated Side Leg Raises: Sit upright in a chair, with your feet flat on the ground. Lift one leg out to the side as far as comfortable, then lower it back down. Repeat for a set of 10-15 repetitions on each leg. This exercise targets your hip abductors (outer thighs).

Remember, it's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional or a certified fitness trainer before starting any new exercise routine, especially if you have specific health concerns. They can provide personalized advice based on your individual needs and limitations.
