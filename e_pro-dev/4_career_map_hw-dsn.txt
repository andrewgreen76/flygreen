Learn how ATmega328 microcontroller works (schematics , design , etc.). 

Networking : How does my plan sound ? : 
If PENA , Reno staffing agencies is a bust : 
 . Bay Area apprenticeships (1-2 yrs) + vocational school certs : 
    . manuf/assy - salary : $14-$25+/hr ; $35k ~ $52k
    v  . IT - salary : $15-$24+/hr ; $48k ~ $100k 
    -> kill -$16k 
    -> save for college 
    -> PCB/CPU/MCU design 
 . Personal project at home : prototyping something somehow , Udemy/Proteus 8 , no building ;
 . On lunch breaks : certs : CompTIA A+ , IPC-A-610 ; IPC EPTAC dates : San Jose, not TX or AZ ; 1/6-9 ; 2/10-13 ; 4/21-24. 

Getting in : forum communities (CPU , PCB , etc.) ; Meetups ; Conventions ; IEEE engagement ; Other social-networking moves 

New job every year : over : $18.50 ; in : manufacturing / assembly 

 . EE degree - from 2-yr trade/voc. school : cheaper than De Anza 
 -> 4-yr school : engineering degree : [else] , SJSU , UT Austin , ASU
