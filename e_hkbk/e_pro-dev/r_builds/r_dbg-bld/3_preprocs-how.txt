    Conditional Compilation: Using preprocessor directives like #ifdef, #ifndef, #if, and #endif, you can conditionally include or exclude blocks of code during compilation based on defined macros or compile-time expressions. For example:

c

#ifdef DEBUG
    printf("Debugging statement\n");
#endif

In the above code, the printf statement will only be included in the compiled code if the DEBUG macro is defined.
