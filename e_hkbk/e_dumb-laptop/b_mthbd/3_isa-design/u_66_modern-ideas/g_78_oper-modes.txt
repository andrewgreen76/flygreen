Real mode, Protected mode, and Long mode are classifications of processor operating modes used in x86 architecture.

===========================================================================================================================================================

1. **Real Mode:** This is the mode of operation that all x86 processors start in when powered on. In real mode, the processor behaves as a simple 16-bit processor, providing a flat memory model and limited access to system resources. It's primarily used for backward compatibility with older software and operating systems.

2. **Protected Mode:** This is a more advanced mode of operation introduced with the Intel 80286 processor and extended in subsequent x86 processors. Protected mode provides features such as memory protection, virtual memory, multitasking, and support for 32-bit addressing. It allows modern operating systems like Windows NT, Linux, and others to utilize the full capabilities of the x86 architecture.

3. **Long Mode:** Long mode is the mode of operation introduced with 64-bit x86 processors (such as AMD64 and Intel 64). It provides support for 64-bit addressing, allowing access to larger amounts of memory (more than 4 GB) and enabling the execution of 64-bit software. Long mode also includes compatibility modes for running 32-bit software.
