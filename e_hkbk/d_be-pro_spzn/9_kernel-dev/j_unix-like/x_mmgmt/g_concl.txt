Paging :
. pros :
  . no external fragmentation
    . But aren't there unused pockets of memory within those pages ?
  . minimal use of virtual address spaces ?
. cons :
  . can be slow (memory access time) 
  . can take up too much memory
  . needs to be designed, implemented, and used with caution
