Starvation :
. The CPU-intensive jobs are stuck waiting on the interactive jobs that eat up all the resources.
. Even if a CPU-intensive job needs to make an I/O request, it will be ignored until the higher-priority jobs are completed.
. This is not fair. We are looking at a problem that needs a solution. 

Gaming the scheduler :
. contriving hacks to allow applications float to the top priority queue
  . ex : reading from / writing to a trivial file 
. not what we want / not a solution
