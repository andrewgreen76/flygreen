FORMATTING DISK SPACE - IN WINDOWS GUI
===================================================================================

Disk Management Utility: 
 . used to reconfigure the disk and its partitions (think FS and boundaries)
 . it is more sensible to reconfigure something like a stick rather a disk with an OS on a computer
 . revamping the FS on a storage drive - or FORMATTING the disk - will erase all of its contents


To open it, right-click "This PC" -> "Manage" -> Storage -> Disk Management.
To reformat a storage device:
  . right-click on the partition/drive
  -> "Format ..."
  . "Allocation unit size" = size of one block
     . choice of 512B / 4KB
     . default = 4KB
    (a) smaller unit size
       => less space will be wasted vs. taking up more bytes unused by the same file within a larger block
    (b) however, it's good to have (large) files reside in larger blocks
       => take up fewer blocks
       => fewer blocks to r/w to work on the file
 (a) quick format:
 (b) full format:
     . Windows will check for corrupted sectors
  . file/folder compression option:
     . less space uptake but needs time to do compression/extraction work
  -> "OK"
