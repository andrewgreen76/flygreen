RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PROTECTION AND MULTITASKING 
========================================================================================

 . "... in real mode, the system typically operates on a single CPU core without effective
      multitasking, while in protected mode, the operating system can utilize all available
      CPU cores for multitasking and concurrent process execution."

 . "The primary mechanism that allows for memory protection in protected mode is the use of
      **segment descriptors** and the **Global Descriptor Table (GDT)**, which define access rights
      and limits for different memory segments, preventing unauthorized access to memory areas
      by processes."

 . once we have memory protection , we can introduce multitasking 
      
 . multitasking is realized with the aid of the context switching mechanism involving the process
     control blocks (PCBs)
