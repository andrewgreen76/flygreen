WHY TRANSISTORS 
===================================================================================

Engineers switched from relays to transistors because transistors are smaller, FASTER, MORE RELIABLE,
CONSUME LESS POWER, and ENABLE COMPACT, HIGH-SPEED ELECTRONIC CIRCUITS, unlike bulky, slow, and power-hungry
mechanical relays.
