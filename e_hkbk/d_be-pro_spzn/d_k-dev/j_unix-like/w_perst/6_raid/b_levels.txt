MIRRORING VS. STRIPING  
===========================================================================================

 . non-redundancy (striping) - storing different pieces of data across different disks 
   . every piece is written to a block (sector) on a separate disk 
   |
   + parallelized distribution => less time to carry out the same I/O vs. doing it with a single disk
   + potentially saves seek time (b/c fewer blocks to R/W) 
   |
   - risk of data loss 

 . redundancy (mirroring) - for reliability (recalling safe duplicate data)

 . parity checks :
    . error-checking
    . fault tolerance
    . reconstruction after disk failure
