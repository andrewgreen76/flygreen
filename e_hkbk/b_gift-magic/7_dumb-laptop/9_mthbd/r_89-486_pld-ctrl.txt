Programmable Logic Devices (PLDs), including Programmable Logic Arrays (PLAs), Programmable Array Logic (PAL), Generic Array Logic (GAL), and Complex Programmable Logic Devices (CPLDs), are commonly used in semiconductor manufacturing for various purposes:

1. **Logic Design Prototyping**: PLDs are used during the prototyping phase of integrated circuit (IC) design to implement and test custom logic functions before committing to fixed silicon designs.

2. **Custom Logic Implementation**: PLDs are used to implement custom logic functions in ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) and FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays). They allow designers to create tailored logic circuits to meet specific application requirements.

3. **Interface Design**: PLDs are employed in the design of interface circuits for connecting different components within an electronic system, such as memory controllers, bus interfaces, and input/output (I/O) interfaces.

4. **Control Logic**: PLDs are used to implement control logic in microcontrollers, digital signal processors (DSPs), and other embedded systems. They help manage system states, handle input/output operations, and control the flow of data within the device.

5. **Hardware Acceleration**: PLDs can be utilized to accelerate specific functions or algorithms in hardware, providing faster execution compared to software implementations running on general-purpose processors.

Overall, PLDs offer flexibility and reconfigurability, making them valuable components in semiconductor manufacturing for implementing custom logic designs in a wide range of applications.

In implementing control logic in modern Microprocessor Units (MPUs), Complex Programmable Logic Devices (CPLDs) are commonly used as PLDs. CPLDs offer a combination of features such as a large number of logic gates, flip-flops, and macrocells, along with programmability, which makes them suitable for implementing complex control logic. 

CPLDs can be programmed to perform various tasks related to control logic, including instruction decoding, pipelining, microcode sequencing, interrupt handling, and bus arbitration. They provide the flexibility required to tailor the control logic to the specific requirements of the MPU architecture while offering fast operation and deterministic timing characteristics. 

Additionally, CPLDs often include integrated features such as clock management, global and local routing resources, and specialized input/output buffers, which further enhance their suitability for implementing control logic in MPUs.
