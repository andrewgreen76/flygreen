32-bit Linux address space :
. invalid : 0x00000000 - ...
. user space : ... - 0xBFFFFFFF
. kernel space : 0xC0000000 - 0xFFFFFFFF
. 64-bit Linux : the split point between user space and kernel space varies 



Adresses in the kernel space :
|
|
. kernel logical addresses :
  . page tables , per-process kernel stacks
  . can NOT be switched to disk
  . direct mapping to RAM
    => always contiguous 
    => "... can be used for activities that require contiguous physical memory, like I/O transfers to and from devices via directory memory access (DMA)." 
     . 32-bit Linux : "0xC0000000 corresponds to 0x00000000, 0xC0000FFF to 0x00000FFF, and so on."
     . 64-bit Linux : the split points vary 
  . kernel calls kmalloc() to expand this section 
|
|
. kernel virtual addresses :
  . kernel calls vmalloc() to start and grow this section 
  . vmalloc() "delivers a pointer to a NEARLY CONTINUOUS region of the necessary size." 
  . "... kernel virtual memory is frequently not contiguous (and is thus not suitable for DMA)."
  . "... utilized for huge buffers where finding a continuous large portion of physical memory is difficult."
  . 32-bit Linux kernel can access memory larger than 1GB
  . 64-bit Linux kernel is allowed to take up even way more than 1GB
