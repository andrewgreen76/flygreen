RINGS OF SECURITY 
========================================================================================

 . a.k.a. privilege levels


 . ring 0 (most privileged) - kernel :
   |
   . manipulating hardware and memory
   | . `CLI` , `STI`
   | 
   . low-level I/O operations (ports , etc.)
   | . `IN` for reading data from an I/O port into a register
   | . `OUT` for writing data from a register into an I/O port
   |
   . changing MMU settings (memory protection , paging settings)
   . instructions for regulating processes and threads
     . `XCHG` , `LOCK` , `CMPXCHG` 


 . ring 1 - device drivers 
 . ring 2 - device drivers 


 . ring 3 (least privileged) - user processes :
   . they get `INT` to call the kernel
   => the system is in ring 0 
   => the kernel goes off of the indicated interrupt and allows running the corresponding int handler
   => the kernel switches the system back to ring 3
