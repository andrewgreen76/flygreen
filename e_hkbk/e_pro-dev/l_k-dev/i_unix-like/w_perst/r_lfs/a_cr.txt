 . recently added and ever-moving imap pieces are written here
 . CR -> imap piece -> inode -> data block
      	      	       	     ^
			     |
			     direct , indirect , doubly-indirect pointers are used to locate the data blocks 


 + LFS caches/updates the imap  
 . happens every 30 secs
    + less frequent => less overhead => better performance
    - not great for preserving FS integrity
