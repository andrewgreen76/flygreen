The process of programming the first-stage bootloader into the System-on-Chip (SoC) of a Raspberry Pi involves several stages and techniques. While the specifics of the process are proprietary and not publicly disclosed by Broadcom, the manufacturer of the SoC used in Raspberry Pi devices, we can provide a general overview of how such operations are typically carried out in semiconductor manufacturing:

1. **Firmware Development**: Before the SoC is manufactured, the first-stage bootloader firmware is developed. This firmware is responsible for initializing critical hardware components, such as the memory controller, clocking system, and basic peripherals, to bring the SoC into a state where it can execute further boot code.

2. **Mask ROM Integration**: The first-stage bootloader code is "masked" into the silicon of the SoC during the fabrication process. This involves creating a custom mask layer during the chip's manufacturing, which embeds the bootloader code directly into the SoC's read-only memory (ROM) cells. These ROM cells are hardwired during the fabrication process and cannot be modified or reprogrammed after manufacturing.

3. **Verification and Testing**: After the SoCs are fabricated, they undergo extensive testing and verification procedures to ensure that the bootloader code is correctly integrated and functioning as expected. This involves running various tests to validate the functionality of the SoC and its bootloader.

4. **Integration into Raspberry Pi Board**: Once verified, the SoCs are integrated into the Raspberry Pi board during the manufacturing process. Other components, such as memory chips, connectors, and peripherals, are also assembled onto the board.

5. **Distribution**: The fully assembled Raspberry Pi boards, with the integrated SoCs containing the first-stage bootloader, are then distributed to end-users.

Overall, the process of programming the first-stage bootloader into the SoC involves a combination of firmware development, semiconductor manufacturing techniques (such as mask ROM integration), and rigorous testing procedures to ensure the reliability and functionality of the bootloader in the Raspberry Pi devices.
