Zero in on a prospect 
Zero in on a POTENTIAL position
Have UNR help prep your resume AND cover letter

(I hope you are the right person/people to send this to.)

What classes should I add for my grad special program if I am looking to pursue a career in ... [see what courses they teach]
- Also I was told that since mine is a non-degree-seeking program, I would have to ask your permission to attend your classes and fill out certain forms.
  Is that true? And if so, where can I find and download those forms so that I can fill them out? And where do I turn them in? 

[Decide on the prospect / check out what they do : 
- embedded systems / OS/RTOS 
- IT / system administration / cybersecurity
