 . "Typically, a memory controller has minimal processing capability for control logic but does not have
    significant memory of its own; it primarily orchestrates access to external memory."
 . "No, the Busicom 141-PF did not have separate component controllers; the Intel 4004 microprocessor itself
    directly managed communication with the 4001 ROM and 4002 RAM chips."
