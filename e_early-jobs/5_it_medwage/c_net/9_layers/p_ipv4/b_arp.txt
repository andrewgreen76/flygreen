We want successful delivery of a packet to the recipient. 

=> The IP datagram must contain the MAC address of the recipient. 

=> We must obtain the MAC address of the destination. How do we do that ? We need …

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) : 

    a protocol where an IP address is resolved to the respective MAC address 
    for the mapping we need an ARP table 
    almost every networking device has its own ARP table 

|

If the sender doesn’t have an ARP entry / MAC address for the recipient with a known IP address , it will send a **broadcast ARP message** with the IP address to the **MAC broadcast address** - FF: FF: FF: FF: FF: FF. 

-> All devices on the network will receive the message and the originally intended recipient will send an **ARP response** containing the MAC address. 

|

ARP entries expire after a short amount of time due to regular IP reassignments.
