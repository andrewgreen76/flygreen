An operating system cannot operate without daemons. Is that correct?

That statement is not entirely accurate. While daemons play an important role in the operation of many operating systems, it is not a strict requirement for an operating system to have daemons in order to function.

Daemons are background processes or services that provide specific functionality or perform tasks independently of user interaction. They handle various system-level functions such as managing network connections, handling system events, scheduling tasks, providing access to hardware devices, and more. Daemons enhance the functionality and capabilities of an operating system by performing these tasks in the background.

However, not all operating systems rely on daemons. Some operating systems, especially embedded systems or minimalist operating systems, may not have a traditional daemon infrastructure. They might have a more streamlined and minimalistic design where system functions are integrated directly into the core operating system components.

In summary, while daemons are commonly used in many operating systems to provide additional functionality and perform background tasks, it is not an absolute requirement for an operating system to have daemons in order to function. The presence or absence of daemons depends on the design and requirements of the specific operating system.
