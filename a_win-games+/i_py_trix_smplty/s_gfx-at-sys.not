If you want to paint a pixel on the monitor itself, outside of a Pygame window, and without displaying the app window, you would typically need to use a platform-specific library or framework. Python alone does not provide a built-in way to directly manipulate the screen pixels at the system level.

Here's an example using the `pyautogui` library, which provides cross-platform support for automating mouse and keyboard actions:

```python
import pyautogui

# Get the screen dimensions
screen_width, screen_height = pyautogui.size()

# Set the pixel position
pixel_position = (screen_width // 2, screen_height // 2)  # Center of the screen

# Set the pixel color (RGB values)
pixel_color = (255, 0, 0)  # Red color

# Move the mouse cursor to the pixel position
pyautogui.moveTo(pixel_position[0], pixel_position[1])

# Change the pixel color by clicking the mouse
pyautogui.click(button='left', clicks=1, interval=0.1)

# Alternatively, you can use the following to directly set the pixel color
# pyautogui.pixel(pixel_position[0], pixel_position[1], color=pixel_color)

# You can also use pyautogui to perform other screen-related actions if needed

```

In this example, the `pyautogui` library is used to interact with the screen. The `size()` function is used to get the screen dimensions, and the pixel position is set to the center of the screen. The `moveTo()` function moves the mouse cursor to the pixel position, and then the `click()` function is used to simulate a mouse click, which effectively changes the color of the pixel at that position.

Please note that manipulating the screen pixels directly at the system level may require special permissions and can have limitations depending on the operating system and hardware. Additionally, such operations may not be recommended for general-purpose applications and should be used with caution.
