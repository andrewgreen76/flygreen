RECOVERY METHODS : 
==================================================================================================================

 (a) use fsck to tend to the entire disk
 (b) journaling :

JOURNALING : 
==================================================================================================================

 . a.k.a. write-ahead logging 


1) keeping record in `struct journal` :
   |  . intended file ops
   |  . target inodes
   |  . target bitmaps/locs
   |  . target data blocks 
   |  . kept between a superblock and a block group somewhere in the middle of the disk
   |
   |
2) recovery using the journal
   |
  (a) "undo" logging for reverting (or "rolling back") changes
   | . a.k.a. "before-image logging"
   |   ( i) inverse operations were logged
   |   (ii) initial state was saved to the journal 
   | => can fall back to INITIAL SAFE STATE 
   |
  (b) "redo" logging for retrying (or "replaying") changes
   | => can try for FINAL SAFE STATE 
   |
   . fixing the targets in the process
