THE ANDREW FILE SYSTEM (AFS) 
========================================================================================

 . a DFS 
 . aims at scalability (compared to NFS) 
 . transparency (between the server and its clients)
    . but security is NOT compromised 


 . AFSv1 introduced whole-file caching
    |
    . in NFS only individual blocks of the target file are cached
    |
    > in AFS the entire file is cached
    . on the client's disk 
    + relying less on the server and network connectivity
      is supposed to improve file management performance
