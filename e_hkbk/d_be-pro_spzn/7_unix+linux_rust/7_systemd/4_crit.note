As an AI language model, my responses are based on the information available up until September 2021. At that time, there were varying opinions and critiques surrounding systemd, a system and service manager used in many Linux distributions. While systemd has gained popularity for its features and integration capabilities, it has also faced criticism from some individuals and communities.

One of the common critiques of systemd is its perceived complexity and the departure from traditional Unix design principles. Critics argue that systemd's approach of integrating multiple functions into one monolithic software suite goes against the Unix philosophy of "doing one thing well." Some also express concerns about its impact on system boot times, resource usage, and the potential for increased system dependencies.

Regarding Benno Rice, I couldn't find any specific information about him criticizing systemd. It's worth noting that systemd has been a topic of discussion and debate within the Linux community, and criticisms and debates are not uncommon when it comes to system-level software.

It's important to keep in mind that opinions about systemd can vary, and it's advisable to explore multiple perspectives and make your own informed judgment based on your specific needs and requirements.
