In the context of your code, both `(void*) memory` and `&memory` refer to the address of the beginning of the `memory` array. However, there is a difference in their types and how they are interpreted.

1. **`(void*) memory`:**
   - This casts the address of the array to a `void*` pointer type. The `void*` type is a generic pointer type in C that can hold the address of any data type. This is commonly used when you want to print or pass around a raw memory address without specifying the type.

2. **`&memory`:**
   - This is the address-of operator, and it returns the address of the entire array `memory`. The type of `&memory` would be a pointer to an array of characters (`char(*)[20000]`).

In the context of your `printf` statement, both `(void*) memory` and `&memory` would work, but you might want to choose based on the type you want to convey:

- If you want to emphasize that you're dealing with a generic pointer to memory and the specific type is not important, you can use `(void*) memory`.
- If you want to be more explicit about the type and indicate that you're dealing with the address of an array of characters, you can use `&memory`.

Here's an example demonstrating the use of both in a similar context:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

char memory[20000];

int main(void) {
  printf("Using (void*) memory: %p\n", (void*) memory);
  printf("Using &memory: %p\n", (void*) &memory);

  return 0;
}
```

The output would be the same for both, but the type information conveyed in the code is different.
