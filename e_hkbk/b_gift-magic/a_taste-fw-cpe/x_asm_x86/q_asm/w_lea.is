The LEA (Load Effective Address) instruction is an x86 assembly language instruction used to calculate and load the effective memory address of a data operand into a general-purpose register. Despite its name, the LEA instruction does not actually access memory; instead, it performs arithmetic operations on addresses.

The syntax of the LEA instruction is as follows:

```assembly
LEA destination, source
```

- `destination`: The destination operand, which is typically a general-purpose register (e.g., `eax`, `ebx`, `rcx`, `rdi`, etc.).
- `source`: The source operand, which is typically a memory address or an expression that evaluates to an address.

The LEA instruction calculates the effective address of the source operand and stores it in the destination operand. This is useful for performing address calculations without accessing the data stored at the address.

Common uses of the LEA instruction include:

1. Calculating the address of an array element or structure member.
2. Calculating the address of a variable with an offset.
3. Performing address arithmetic for indexed addressing modes in array processing.
4. Generating addresses for function arguments or parameters.

Here's a simple example in x86 assembly language that demonstrates the LEA instruction:

```assembly
section .data
    my_data db 10

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    lea eax, [my_data]    ; Load the address of my_data into EAX
```

In this example, the LEA instruction loads the effective address of the `my_data` variable into the `eax` register without actually accessing the data stored at that address.

The LEA instruction is a versatile tool in assembly language programming, often used for optimizing address calculations and addressing modes in complex memory operations.
