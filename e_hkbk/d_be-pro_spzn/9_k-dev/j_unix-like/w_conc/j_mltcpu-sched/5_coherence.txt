Cache coherence problem :
 |
 |
 . When a process migrates from one CPU to another , it loses the connection to its old cache with all the frequently needed data therein.
 |  => At this point the new cache would have to access the same frequently needed data that used to be instantly available to the process. 
 |
 . => multiple (local) caches copying the same data
 |    => overhead : wasting cache space on the same data 
 |    => overhead : eating up CPU time with RAM lookups and copies to cache
 |
 . in the event of CPU-RAM overwrite ...
    . there is nothing that would update cache(s) 
    => lack of data consistency between caches ("incoherent data")

==================================================================================================

Side note :
 . "local cache" = just "cache"
 . typically a cache that is closer to the CPU
