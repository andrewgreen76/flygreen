Yes, there has been work done in Rust for the Linux kernel and systemd, although the usage of Rust in these projects is still relatively limited compared to other languages like C.

Linux Kernel:

    Rust in the Linux kernel is a topic of ongoing exploration and experimentation. While the Linux kernel itself is primarily written in C, there have been efforts to introduce Rust code in specific subsystems or components. For example, projects like "Project Verona" and "Rust for Linux" have explored the use of Rust in the kernel for improved memory safety and concurrency.

Systemd:

    Systemd, the popular init system and service manager for many Linux distributions, has some components implemented in Rust. For instance, the systemd-homed utility, which provides support for managing user home directories, is implemented in Rust.
    Additionally, there are Rust-based alternatives and libraries that aim to provide functionality similar to systemd. For example, "nix-systemd" is a Rust library that provides abstractions for system services and unit files.

It's worth noting that the adoption of Rust in these projects is still in its early stages, and the majority of the codebase in the Linux kernel and systemd remains in C. The Rust programming language brings safety and performance advantages, but introducing a new language into mature projects like the Linux kernel requires careful consideration and evaluation of the associated benefits and challenges.
