When was Ethernet born?
ChatGPT

Ethernet was born in the early 1970s. The development of Ethernet can be traced back to the efforts of Robert Metcalfe, who worked at Xerox Corporation's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC). In 1973, Metcalfe and his team at PARC invented Ethernet as a local area networking (LAN) technology.

The first working Ethernet system, known as Ethernet Version 1.0, was implemented in 1973. It operated at a speed of 2.94 Mbps (megabits per second) and used a coaxial cable as the transmission medium. This early version of Ethernet became the foundation for the Ethernet standards that followed.

Ethernet went through further developments and improvements, leading to the release of Ethernet Version 2.0 in 1982. This version introduced several significant enhancements, including an increase in data rate to 10 Mbps and the adoption of the CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) media access control method.

Since then, Ethernet has continued to evolve and has become the dominant LAN technology used in various industries and applications. It has seen multiple speed upgrades, such as Fast Ethernet (100 Mbps), Gigabit Ethernet (1 Gbps), 10 Gigabit Ethernet (10 Gbps), and beyond. Ethernet has become a standard networking technology for both local area networks (LANs) and wide area networks (WANs).
