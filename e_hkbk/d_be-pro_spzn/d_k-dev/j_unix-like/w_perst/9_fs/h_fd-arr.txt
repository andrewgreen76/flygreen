Every individual process has its own private ("independent") array of file descriptors (stdin, stdout, stderr, custom+).
 . even if there is more than one process
 . whether they are related or not
 . proc 1 can have fd 3 , proc 2 can have its own fd 3 , etc.



The OFT (open file table) is shared.
 => fd's from different arrays can reference the same OFT entry
 | . using fork() , dup functions
 |
 . BUT THE OFT ENTRY CAN ONLY HAVE ONE OFFSET , ONE INODE
 |
 . the REFERENCE COUNT keeps track of how many fd's have the file open
