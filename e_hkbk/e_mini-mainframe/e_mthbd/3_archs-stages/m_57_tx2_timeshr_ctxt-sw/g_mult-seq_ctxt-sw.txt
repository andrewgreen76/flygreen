MULTIPLE SEQUENCE AND INTERRUPTS : 
========================================================================================

A sequence (subroutine) can fire off an interrupt to trigger another sequence (i.e., context switching). 

"
In a multiple-sequence system like the Lincoln Laboratory TX-2, interrupts are used to efficiently switch between different sequences of instructions or tasks by pausing the current sequence, handling an interrupt, and then resuming or switching to another sequence, thereby enabling multitasking and responsive computing.

"
Task Switching: Multiple-sequence systems are designed to handle multiple tasks or processes concurrently. Interrupts play a crucial role in this by allowing the system to switch between tasks efficiently. When an interrupt occurs, the CPU can save the state of the current task, handle the interrupt, and then resume or switch to another task.

EXAMPLE : 
========================================================================================

"
This "multiple sequence" computer contains 33 sequence counters (32 normal sequence counters, held in the upper 32 of 64 index registers, and one special sequence counter, held in index register 0); each operates at the fixed priority corresponding its index register number. J.W. Forgie, in "The Lincoln TX-2 input-output system," in Proc. WJCC, February 1957, pp. 156-160, lists 25 defined sequences:

    restart - highest priority, special sequence used for starting other sequences (index register 0)
    I/O alarms
    arithmetic alarms (e.g., overflow)
    magnetic tapes (several sequences, also one sequence needed per transfer direction, that is, a read sequence for a given tape is separate from the write sequence for that tape)
    printer
    ADC
    paper tape readers (several sequences)
    light pen
    display (several sequences)
    MTC
    TX-0
    DAC
    paper tape punch
    flexowriters (several sequences)
    three main sequences
