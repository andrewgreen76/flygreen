# Welcome to the experimental edutainment/multi-tutorial repository. 

__________________________________________________________________________
The PURPOSE of this repo:
__________________________________________________________________________

To help individuals, with or without a technical background, to:
- fill in the gaps left by their formal education or, if they didn't have any,
  provide them with comprehensive alternative education;
  - (especially for beginners)
    - hone their programming skills,
    - internalize key programming and engineering concepts,
    - learn about different systems,
    - understand and build a perspective on modern computing through studying
      its history.
- grow a portfolio; 
- improve their productivity in general (combatting ADD, figuring out
  alternatives to unhealthy solutions, etc.);

TOPICS AND METHODS EXPLORED TO AN EXTENT OVER THE PAST 24-48 HOURS:

- C programming :
  - direct memory access with bitwise operations and bit-masking 
  - getline() multiple-mem-check and malloc()/free() depedence -vs.- scanf() single-check and malloc()/free() independence ; 
  - passing by pointer instead of passing by reference
  - sprintf(string, "%d", integer)
  - image (bitmap file) metadata attributes,
    - working with bytes (int32_t, uint16_t, uint32_t)
    - alignment requirements and byte padding
  - BMP header structures
  - fread(.., sizeof * structObj, .., ..)
  - Linux assistance with hardware : SDL, OpenGL, and ALSA (PCM tone generation)

- (TBA)

Planned projects for the future : 
- helping to maintain [the Linux kernel, systemd, 0AD video game, Pop!_OS kernel, coreboot codebase, etc.]

CHOSEN PERSONAL PROJECT:
__________________________________________________________________________

- Just A GAME FOR DOSBOX is fine.
- own package -or- release / command. 
> |
> -
- a virtual machine,
- an emulator,
- or a video game that poses as an operating system (a la Last Call BBS).
  - Can I use the Unity Engine for that?
  - research dedicated toolchains. 
- challenge: faithful resolution
- plan of attack:
  - fide: 320x200
  - now: 1920x1200, 6 times both ways.
  - consider fair, authentic scaling. 
- learn BIOS-kernel-API/DSP-distro ladder for that 
- An API / display server protocol for a 13h-like mode portable to any headless system.
