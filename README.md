The PURPOSE of this repo:
__________________________________________________________________________

To help individuals, with or without a technical background:
- hone their programming skills; 
- internalize key programming and engineering concepts; 
- learn about different systems; 
- understand and build a perspective on modern computing through studying
  its history; 
- grow a portfolio; 
- improve their productivity in general (combatting ADD, figuring out
  alternatives to unhealthy solutions, etc.). 

To help individuals with a technical background:
- fill in the gaps left by their formal education; 
- get a comprehensive alternative education.

CHOSEN PROFESSIONAL PROJECT: 
- [currently studying for a Google IT certification]
__________________________________________________________________________
CHOSEN PERSONAL PROJECTS:
- [currently studying for a Google IT certification]
- 4-/8-bit ALU design
- your own AI ... without conventional NN training
- [ruled out] game engine in C (requires porting to an OS that isn't yours)
- [ruled out] programming an MCU (e.g., STM32L152RET6 - account for PICkit 4/5 costs)
- [ruled out] RISC-V OSOC project (toolchain, example cores)
- [ruled out] NanOS (GCC, build instructions, trial in QEMU)
