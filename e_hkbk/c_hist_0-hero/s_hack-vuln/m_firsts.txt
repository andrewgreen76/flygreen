FIRST RECORDED INSTANCES OF VARIOUS TYPES OF VULNERABILITY EXPLOITS : 
========================================================================================

 . c. 1970 : information disclosure 
   . "... exploring the capabilities of networked computing, without the security measures
      that are commonplace today. This experimental environment led to instances of unintentional
      information disclosure.

      One notable example involves misconfigured file permissions on network-accessible servers.
      Researchers and system administrators might have inadvertently set file permissions in a way
      that allowed unauthorized users to access sensitive data. This could include research findings,
      system configurations, or other information that was meant to be restricted."



 . 1971 : privilege escalation 
   . "Password File"
   . attack on the UNIX operating system
   . "attackers exploited a vulnerability in the system's password file to gain elevated access privileges"



 . 1974 : DoS (denial of service)
   . "Christmas Attack" - heavy traffic sent to ARPANET 
   . crashed the network's IMPs (Interface Message Processors)



 . 1985 : authentication bypass
   . by "Len de Bruxelles" 
   . "vulnerabilities in the Unix rsh (remote shell) service"
   . "to gain unauthorized access without providing valid credentials"



 . 1988 : buffer overflow attack / code injection 
   . Morris Worm
   . "a programming error"
   . by Robert Tappan Morris - "the first person to be convicted under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act" 
   . released on November 2, 1988 
   . fingerd buffer overflow exploit
     = feeding an excessively long input to a program for buffering 
     + using primitive C functions
     => string-buffer overflow
     => overwriting the memory that follows (BP , ret)
     => overwritten ret can lead to somewhere in the middle of the NOP-sled
     -> NOP-sled leads to the entry point of malicious code 
   . sendmail debug-mode exploit
   . "weak password guessing" 
   . "unintentional recursion (rapid replication of the worm) that caused the worm to replicate more aggressively than intended"
   . "... his intention was not to cause harm, but rather to gauge the size of the internet"
   



 . 1988 : session hijacking
   . the "Session Hijacking Demonstration" tool by hacker Craig Neidorf
   . "illustrating the exploitation of insecure connections to intercept and take over user sessions" 



 . 2001 : cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
   . by RSnake
   . "a malicious website coerced a user's browser to make unauthorized requests to another site
      where the user was authenticated"

KEVIN MITNICK AND ARPANET : 
========================================================================================

"
... the 1980 incident involving the ARPANET, the precursor to the modern internet. This breach was carried out by a group of high school students from Los Angeles, who managed to gain unauthorized access to ARPANET using simple password-guessing techniques.

In 1980, these students, led by a teenager named Kevin Mitnick, exploited weak passwords and poor security practices to break into ARPANET, accessing several military and research computer systems. Their activities were eventually discovered, leading to increased awareness of the need for stronger security measures in computer networks. This incident marked one of the earliest examples of a computer system security breach and highlighted the importance of securing computer networks against unauthorized access.

HANNOVER HACKERS : 
========================================================================================

"
... the 1986 incident involving the hacking group known as the "Hannover Hackers," particularly Clifford Stoll's experience detailed in his book *The Cuckoo's Egg*. This group of German hackers, including Markus Hess, infiltrated various military and research systems in the United States, exploiting vulnerabilities in those systems.

Markus Hess, one of the hackers, breached systems at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and other sensitive locations. The hackers' activities were not just unauthorized but also dangerous, as they accessed systems that controlled critical infrastructure and contained sensitive information. Stoll, an astronomer turned systems administrator, discovered the intrusion and meticulously tracked down the hackers, eventually leading to their identification and prosecution. This case highlighted the vulnerabilities of computer systems and the potential dangers of unauthorized access, marking a significant moment in the history of cybersecurity.
