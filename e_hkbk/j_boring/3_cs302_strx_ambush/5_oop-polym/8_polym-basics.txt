POLYMORPHISM :
 . subtype (runtime polym)
    . typical polym
    . simply replacing the base class with children
    . works because of inheritance 
 . parametric (compile-time polym)
 . ad-hoc (overloading)
 . coersion (casting) 

DIRECT REL-P B/W INHER. AND RUNTIME POLYM.

explain runtime vs. compile-time polym 

subtype polym 
 . runtime polym
 . base class pointer = placeholder in code
 . capitalizes on passing by reference - saving memory
 . inheritance + saving memory + passing a child as the Base type (better type coverage)
 . 'virtual' saves memory
 . can't instantiate the base class
 . parent-child type flexibility with arguments in a class function

parametric
 . compile-time

ad-hoc

coersion
 . casting
