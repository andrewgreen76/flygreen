/*
Can you give me a few lines of code to start off with for writing the dumbest kernel from scratch?
ChatGPT

Sure! Here's a basic skeleton for a simple kernel in C:

scss*/

void kernel_main() {
  while(1) {
    // Do nothing
  }
}
 
void _start() {
  kernel_main();
}

/*
This kernel simply enters an infinite loop and does nothing else. You can build on this skeleton to create a more complete kernel. Keep in mind that writing an operating system kernel is a non-trivial task, and there are many details to consider.
