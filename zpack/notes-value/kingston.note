A Kingston lock, also known as a Kensington lock, is a type of security mechanism designed to prevent theft of laptops, desktop computers, and other electronic devices.

The lock consists of a metal cable with a lock at one end and a small, rectangular slot on the device to be secured. The cable is looped around a stationary object, such as a desk or table leg, and then the lock is inserted into the slot on the device. Once the lock is engaged, it cannot be removed without the key.

The Kingston lock was invented by Kensington Computer Products Group, which is now a part of ACCO Brands. The lock has become a standard feature on many laptops and desktop computers, and is commonly used in schools, libraries, and other public places where electronic devices may be left unattended.
