. Difference : a part of an OS
  . boot sector in .asm
. explore /dev/* (/zero, /null, etc.)

- an emulator (VM) 
- learn BIOS-kernel-API/DSP-distro ladder for that 
- An API / display server protocol for a 13h-like mode portable to any server-like system.

Suppose I want to write a very dumb bootloader. I know that to do that an assembly file needs to be written and converted to binary. The first 512 bytes would be the boot sector (with the last two bytes being 0x55 0xAA).
