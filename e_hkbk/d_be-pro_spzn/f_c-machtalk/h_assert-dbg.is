Is the "assert" token used in C and C++?
ChatGPT

Yes, the "assert" token is used in both C and C++.

In C, the "assert" macro is defined in the "assert.h" header file. It is commonly used for debugging purposes to verify assumptions in the code. The "assert" macro takes an expression as an argument and checks if it evaluates to true. If the expression is false, the "assert" macro triggers an assertion failure, which typically causes the program to terminate and print an error message.

In C++, the "assert" macro is also available and works similarly to the one in C. However, C++ also provides a more flexible alternative called "assertion handling" through the "cassert" header file. The "cassert" header file defines the "assert" macro as well, but it also allows you to define your own behavior for assertion failures by using the "NDEBUG" preprocessor directive and providing custom implementation for the "assert" macro.

Both in C and C++, the "assert" macro is commonly used during development to catch programming errors or unexpected conditions. It helps to validate assumptions and detect potential issues in the code.
