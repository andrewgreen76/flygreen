- a two-input NAND is like a two-input AND but with an inversion
  = 2 two transistors / switch
  + 2 two transistors / switch
  + 2 two transistors / inverter
  + 2 two transistors / inverter, but do you really need this one ? 

  = 2 two transistors / switch
  + 2 two transistors / switch

  = 4+ transistors.
