If we go to linker.ld , you'll notice that our OUTPUT_FORMAT is binary.
  Now this is all fine , but when we start C with assembly , it can cause
  alignment issues. Now , C requires functions to be aligned in a certain
  way, and when we are writing assembly - in kernel.asm , for example -
  - and we are linking with object files created with the C compiler ,
  our assembly might not align correctly.
