To close or "abort" the Firefox browser from the terminal in Ubuntu, you can use the `pkill` command. This command is used to send signals to processes by name.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Open the terminal.
2. Run the following command:

```bash
pkill firefox
```

This command will send the default signal (SIGTERM) to all Firefox processes, prompting them to terminate. If there are multiple Firefox windows or tabs open, this command will close all of them.

Please note that this will force Firefox to close abruptly without giving it a chance to save any open tabs or data. Use this command cautiously. If you want to close Firefox gracefully, it's recommended to use the browser's built-in exit functionality.
