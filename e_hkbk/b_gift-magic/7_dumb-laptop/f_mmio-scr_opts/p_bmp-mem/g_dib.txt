A DIB (Device Independent Bitmap) file is a bitmap image file format used to store raster graphics independently of the display device. DIB files are commonly associated with Microsoft Windows and are used to represent bitmap images in a device-independent manner. They are sometimes referred to as BMP (Bitmap) files, as the BMP format is a specific implementation of DIB.

Key features of DIB files include:

1. **Device Independence:** DIB files store bitmap images in a format that is independent of the display device's characteristics, such as resolution or color depth. This allows the same DIB file to be displayed on different devices without loss of quality.

2. **File Structure:** DIB files follow a specific file structure that includes a file header containing information about the file and a bitmap information header describing the characteristics of the bitmap, such as width, height, color depth, and compression method.

3. **Color Depth:** DIB files can support various color depths, including 1-bit monochrome, 4-bit indexed color, 8-bit indexed color, 24-bit true color, and others.

4. **Compression:** DIB files can be either compressed or uncompressed. Common compression methods include RLE (Run-Length Encoding) compression.

5. **Compatibility:** DIB files are widely supported by graphics software on Windows platforms, making them a commonly used format for storing bitmap images.

While DIB files and BMP files are often used interchangeably, it's worth noting that BMP files can also include other bitmap formats that are not strictly DIB. DIB is specifically associated with the device-independent characteristics of the bitmap data in the file.
