CIDR (CLASSLESS INTER-DOMAIN ROUTING) 
===================================================================================

 . We totally could use the [networkID . subnetID . hostID] approach to routing packets.
 . "Before this , if a company needed just a few more addresses than a single class C could provide , they could
      upgrade to higher-class equipment or they'd need an entire class C" and you would need two individual ARP
      tables to route any packet.
 . If a company purchased equipment under a class that could cover a wide host IP address space , the routers would
     have ARP tables with unused (read: wasted) IP addresses , which means a waste of hardware (read: RAM) resources. 
 

The CIDR approach :
  |
  . allows for more FLEXIBILIY/BALANCE in terms of host IP address coverage needed for a business 
  |
  . this is where the /slash notation for subnetting comes in
  . the octet format is not particularly useful now 
  . the dots in an IP address are just there for reference at this point
  . network classes are no longer needed
  |
  . ex.: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/xx 
  |
  . this is where we demarcate networks - give an idea numerically where one network ends and another begins 
  . uses subnet masks for demarcating networks 
  . [ {networkID.subnetID} . hostID]


Every new network will actually lose two host IDs in its host IP address space - the 0 and the all-ones.
