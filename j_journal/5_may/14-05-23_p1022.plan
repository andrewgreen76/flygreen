    I wrote in my README.md manifesto "to use, to show off, to learn, to hack"
as my personal interpretation of the GNU spirit. So I'm showing off and sharing
my knowledge of things like the environment variables in my Linux "module" of
the dir e_hkbk (hackbook, formerly known as progbook). This stuff is really fun
but also really scary to experiment with. And the really messed-up part is that
my Linux environment remembers a copy/reference to PS1 (prompt string 1) variable
through the use of commands like echo and PS1=, whereas I have another copy of
that variable in my .bashrc, with a different value (set of ANSI escape sequences).
Maybe once I source ~/.bashrc, everything about the prompt will go back to
the default settings?

    I've yet to continue pushing through my Linux kernel development journey
because I got so sidetracked with my full-time work and all the findings I got
via ChatGPT. Deep breath. Something needs to be done.
