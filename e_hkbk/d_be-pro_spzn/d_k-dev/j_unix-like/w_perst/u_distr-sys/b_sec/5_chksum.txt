CHECKSUMS - FOR DETECTION AND RECOVERY   
===================================================================================


Why a CHECKSUM :
 |
 |
 . a 4B-8B number (written in hex) 
 . represents the state of much larger corresponding data 
 |  . 1 memory block (a few KB) 
 |  . 1 disk sector  (512 B)
 |  . 1 packet	     (1.5KB , 64KB , etc.)
 |
 . naturally , old and new checksums are compared to detect unwarranted change 


Computation : 
 =  f ( large data )



Stored where :
 . in the inode table 
 . between data blocks
 . etc. 



Trade-offs :
 |
 |
 + supreme error detection
 |  . missed by parity checks 
 |  . silent faults 
 |
 - resource-intensive
 - periodic use , not persistent 
 |
 => more sophisticated than parity checks
