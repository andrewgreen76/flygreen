Child process : gets an address space of its own
Threads : implemented abstractions that work like processes but share the same address space
. multiple execution locations
. context switching applies to threads as well
. every thread has   
  . a single task
  . register values
  . a stack that is shares within the same address space
    => yes , threads can access any data within the same stack space of the same process 
     . stacks don't have to be big  
  . a thread control block (TCB), used to store and load the state of the thread
    . just like PCB, which stores and loads the state of a process



PT does not need to change whenever context switching takes place.
