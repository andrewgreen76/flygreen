When during boot does anything related to networking come in?

During the boot process, the initialization of networking-related components typically occurs after the kernel has been loaded and initialized, but before the user-space services are fully started. The exact timing can vary depending on the specific Linux distribution, configuration, and network setup.

Here is a general overview of when networking-related events occur during the boot process:

    Kernel Initialization: The kernel initializes the essential hardware components and sets up the core system functionalities.

    Initramfs (if used): If an initramfs is present, it may include necessary network-related modules or firmware to enable network connectivity. This step can vary based on the specific setup and requirements.

    Systemd Init: Once the kernel has initialized, systemd is launched as the init system. systemd manages the startup process, including network-related tasks.

    Network Device Detection: systemd, through its udev subsystem, detects and configures network devices such as Ethernet adapters or Wi-Fi interfaces. It assigns names (like eth0, wlan0) to these devices and triggers the necessary initialization routines.

    Network Service Activation: systemd activates the network services responsible for establishing network connectivity. This includes configuring network interfaces, obtaining IP addresses via DHCP or static configuration, and setting up routing tables.

    Network Time Synchronization: After the network connectivity is established, systemd can initiate the synchronization of the system clock with network time servers (NTP) to ensure accurate timekeeping.

It's important to note that the specific sequence and timing can vary based on the distribution and the configuration of the system. Additionally, if you have custom network configurations or additional network-related services, the boot sequence may be further customized to accommodate those specific requirements.
