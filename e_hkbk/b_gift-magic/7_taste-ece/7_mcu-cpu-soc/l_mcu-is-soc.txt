There are several types of SoCs available, including:

1. **Application Processors**: Used in smartphones and tablets (e.g., Qualcomm Snapdragon, Apple A-series).

2. **Embedded Processors**: Designed for specific applications, often found in automotive or industrial settings (e.g., NXP i.MX, Texas Instruments Sitara).

3. **FPGA-based SoCs**: Combine a traditional processor with FPGA fabric, allowing for hardware reconfiguration (e.g., Xilinx Zynq, Intel Cyclone).

4. **Digital Signal Processors (DSPs)**: Optimized for processing digital signals (e.g., Texas Instruments C6000 series).

5. **Network Processors**: Designed for processing network packets (e.g., Broadcom StrataGX, Cisco QuantumFlow).

6. **GPU SoCs**: Combine a GPU with a CPU for graphics-intensive applications (e.g., NVIDIA Tegra, AMD Ryzen with Radeon graphics).

7. **IoT SoCs**: Targeted for Internet of Things devices, often low-power (e.g., Espressif ESP32, Nordic Semiconductor nRF52 series).

Each of these types of SoCs is tailored for specific use cases and performance requirements.
