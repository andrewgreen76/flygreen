PACKETS AND DATAGRAMS 
==================================================================================

Packet :
 . the smallest structure for holding and transferring data
 . has its own format (header, body, etc.)
 . packets may or may not have relation between one another
    . relation for the sake of ordered communication (1st packet , 2nd packet , etc.)
 . packets can be buffered together to form a single message prior to transmission 


Datagram :
 . an independent packet (may be sent unordered with other datagrams) 



==================================================================================
PACKET LOSS , CORRUPTION , DROP : 
==================================================================================


Causes of loss / corruption :
 |
 . electrical issues (ground interference , etc.)
    => some bits get inverted
    
 . network link is damaged (cable is nicked) 
 . packet router is damaged
 . remote host system is damaged



Packet drop :
 . every network switch / network router has a buffer for M incoming packets
 . N packets come in (M<N)    =>    packets collide , N-M packets are dropped
