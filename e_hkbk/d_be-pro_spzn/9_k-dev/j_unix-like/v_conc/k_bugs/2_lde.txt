Limited direct execution (LDE) :
 |
 |
 . (roughly speaking , in the context of CPU virtualization)
 | the principle of following the round-robin scheduling algorithm
 |
 |
 . gives the illusion of all processes - user processes and the kernel - running concurrently
 |
 |
 . the kernel :
    . manages processes (and the task list) and the memory hierarchy for them (stack and heap , CPU/cache registers) 
    . handles interrupts , system calls , traps , etc.
 . user processes :
    . do whatever they need to do
