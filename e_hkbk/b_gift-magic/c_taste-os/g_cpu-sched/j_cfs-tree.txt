CFS holds processes with their vruntimes in a red-black tree.
. self-balancing tree
  . balancing is enforced to support O(log(n)) search, insertion, and deletion times FOR EVERY NODE
    . (vs. less time for one node, more time for another node) 
    . n = number of processes to keep track of
    . in an OS there can be at most thousands of processes, if not 
  . balance is maintained through tracking and moving red and black nodes 
  . rebalancing occurs at every insertion and every deletion
  |
  . (re)balancing rules :
    . every node is either red or black 
    . the root is black
    . leaves (nil nodes) are black
    . no consecutive reds along any one path
    . every red parent has two black children 
    . all paths from a node to its every leaf should have the same black height
      . black height = number of black nodes from the node to a leaf
