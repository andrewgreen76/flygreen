In the context of memory management, swapping is a technique primarily implemented by operating systems rather than virtual machines (VMs) or emulators. 

1. Virtual Machines (VMs): When it comes to swapping in VMs, the responsibility lies with the underlying host operating system. The host OS manages the allocation and swapping of memory pages for all the running VMs. The VM itself is not directly involved in the swapping process. If the host's physical memory becomes full, the host OS may employ swapping techniques, such as moving inactive memory pages to disk, to free up memory for other processes or VMs.

2. Emulators: Emulators, like VMs, also rely on the host operating system's memory management mechanisms. When running an emulator, such as an Android emulator or a gaming console emulator, the host OS manages memory allocation and swapping for the emulator process. The emulator itself does not typically implement its own swapping mechanisms.

It's important to note that while VMs and emulators may benefit indirectly from the host OS's swapping, the actual swapping process occurs at the operating system level, outside the virtualization or emulation layer. The VM or emulator relies on the host OS for memory management and may experience performance impacts if the host system heavily relies on swapping due to memory pressure.

Therefore, swapping is a functionality provided by the host operating system, and VMs and emulators utilize the underlying host OS's swapping capabilities rather than implementing swapping mechanisms themselves.
