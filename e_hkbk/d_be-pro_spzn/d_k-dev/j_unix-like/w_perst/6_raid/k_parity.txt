Error :
 . an inadvertent change of a bit of data due to a fault
 . certain solutions are based on the idea that only a single bit would change
 => WE ARE ASSUMING ONLY A SINGLE ERROR WOULD HAPPEN 

ECC - error-checking code : 
 . many ways to design and implement error-checking 
 . parity comparison - one of those solutions 

Parity : 
 . possessing either of two mathematical states : even or odd 
 . the parity of the SUM OF 1'S in the data , not the parity of the data 

Parity bit :
 . used in detecting errors (erroneous changes) within data stored on RAID disks
 . parity bits accompany corresponding data
 . a single error => changed parity => error detected 
 . error checking : comparing pre-calculated parity bits with the newly calculated ones

Parity bit calculations : 
 . handled by (a) the RAID controller or (b) the host's CPU
 . instead of (sum+1)%2 use XOR : 
    . [disk 0:] 1  XOR  [disk 1:] 0  XOR

Parity disk : 
 . stores pre-calculated parity bits to be matched with a next set of more recently calculated parity bits
 . mis-match => error 
 . used in RAID 3 and RAID 4
 . otherwise , parity bits would be distributed across disks , like in RAID 5 and RAID 6 
================================================================================
Odd parity arrangement :

 . (1's in data + [parity_bit] ) = odd number of 1's
 
   1011001 1  =>  1 = parity bit 
   1101011 0  =>  0 = parity bit
================================================================================
Even parity arrangement :
  
 . (1's in data + [parity_bit] ) = even number of 1's
 
   1101011 1  =>  1 = parity bit
   1110001 0  =>  0 = parity bit
