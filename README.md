# Welcome to the experimental edutainment/multi-tutorial repository. 
__________________________________________________________________________
The PURPOSE of this repo:
__________________________________________________________________________

To help individuals, with or without a technical background:
- hone their programming skills; 
- internalize key programming and engineering concepts; 
- learn about different systems; 
- understand and build a perspective on modern computing through studying
  its history; 
- grow a portfolio; 
- improve their productivity in general (combatting ADD, figuring out
  alternatives to unhealthy solutions, etc.). 

To help individuals with a technical background:
- fill in the gaps left by their formal education; 
- get a comprehensive alternative education.

[REJECTED - PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE]
  | 
  A legacy BIOS/UEFI (x86) -based OS :
  - 32-bit
  ? multiboot2 -compliant ?? 
  - to be tested in QEMU
  - to be shipped for Raspberry Pi

ABANDONED PROJECT IDEAS:
__________________________________________________________________________

- a game for Linux 
  - OpenGL 
  - drivers (dev's)
    - framebuffer
    - SDL mixer / ALSA 

- a game like a built-in OS

- a game for DosBox
- an emulator (VM) 
- learn BIOS-kernel-API/DSP-distro ladder for that 
- An API / display server protocol for a 13h-like mode portable to any server-like system.
