Addressing modes in computer architecture refer to the methods used to specify operands for instructions. Different addressing modes provide flexibility in how operands are accessed and manipulated. The concept of addressing modes is not specific to real mode but is a fundamental aspect of various processor architectures.

In the context of x86 architecture, which includes real mode, several addressing modes are available. Here are some common addressing modes:

1. **Immediate Addressing Mode:**
   - The operand is a constant value that is part of the instruction itself.

2. **Register Addressing Mode:**
   - The operand is located in a processor register.

3. **Direct Addressing Mode:**
   - The effective address of the operand is given directly in the instruction.

4. **Indirect Addressing Mode:**
   - The operand's effective address is obtained indirectly through a memory location that contains the actual address.

5. **Register Indirect Addressing Mode:**
   - The operand's effective address is obtained indirectly through a register.

6. **Base-Register Addressing Mode:**
   - An offset is added to a base register to compute the operand's effective address.

7. **Indexed Addressing Mode:**
   - An index register is added to a base register (with optional offset) to compute the operand's effective address.

8. **Scaled-Indexed Addressing Mode:**
   - Combines an index register, a base register, and a scaling factor to compute the operand's effective address.

9. **Relative Addressing Mode:**
   - The operand's effective address is computed relative to the current instruction's address.

These addressing modes allow for diverse ways to specify where operands are located in memory or registers. While real mode in x86 architecture supports these addressing modes, later modes like protected mode and long mode (64-bit mode) introduce additional features and capabilities, such as expanded address space, memory protection, and enhanced addressing modes.
