THE FLOW of a computer booting process : 
 . power-on
 -> BIOS' POST
 -> boot device / OS selection (per the configured boot order)
 -> running the bootloader
 -> running the kernel + manager modules (incl. using device drivers)
 -> running system processes
 -> running the user space 


BOOTLOADER :
 . a small BIOS-level program with instructions telling the CPU how to load the OS data from the image into the RAM
