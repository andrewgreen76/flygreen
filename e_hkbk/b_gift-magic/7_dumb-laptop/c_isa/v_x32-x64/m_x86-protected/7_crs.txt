... there is indeed a Control Register 4 (CR4) in the x86 architecture. 

CR4 is used in protected mode and long mode (64-bit mode) to control various system features and processor extensions. It includes bits that enable and disable features such as virtualization (VMX), various operating system support bits, and other architectural extensions.

So, the sequence of control registers in the x86 architecture is CR0, CR2, CR3, and CR4. Each control register serves specific functions related to system control, memory management, and processor features.

The Control Register (CR) numbering in x86 architecture starts from CR0 and continues up to CR4, but there is no CR1 register. 

The reason for this numbering convention lies in the historical evolution of the x86 architecture and the purpose of each control register. When Intel introduced the protected mode in the 80286 processor, they designated the first control register as CR0. Subsequent x86 processors introduced additional control registers for specific purposes, such as enabling paging (CR3) and controlling debug features (CR4).

The absence of CR1 does not indicate a skipped or unused register; rather, it's simply a convention chosen by Intel for the naming and numbering of control registers in the x86 architecture. Each control register serves a specific purpose and is used for different aspects of CPU operation and system management.
