DEVICES IN LINUX
===================================================================================

 . everything in Linux is a file 
 . devices are (represented as) files


Actual physical devices:
 |
 . character devices:
   . input devices (that send data in a byte stream, i.e., character after character), e.g., keyboard, mouse, etc.
   . /dev/zero : feeds an endless stream of zeros (null bytes)
   . /dev/null : the black hole to pipe unwanted data to
   . “You can verify that /dev/zero is a character device using the ls -l command. The output will show a ‘c’ at
      the beginning of the permissions field, which stands for "character device.”
   . all are represented as files
 . block devices
   . storage devices 
   . i.e., they transfer data in blocks
   . 1 block = 512B / 4KB
   . all are also represented as files
   . /dev/sda , /dev/sdb , ... - storage devices (sd)

   $ ls -l
   : b ??? ??? ???    # ‘b’ : block device
