No, the Apple II was not a Unix-like system. The Apple II was a series of personal computers developed by Apple Inc. in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It did not run a Unix-like operating system. Instead, it used the Apple DOS operating system, which was a proprietary operating system developed by Apple for the Apple II series. Unix-like systems typically refer to operating systems that follow the design principles of the Unix operating system, which include features like multitasking, multi-user support, and a command-line interface.
