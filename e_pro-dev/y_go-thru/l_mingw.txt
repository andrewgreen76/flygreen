MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows) is a development environment for creating native Windows applications. It provides:

- **GCC Compiler**: The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) for compiling C, C++, and Fortran code on Windows.
- **GNU Tools**: Essential tools like `make`, `gdb`, and other utilities needed for development.
- **Minimalist Runtime**: A minimal runtime environment that includes headers and libraries required to build Windows applications without needing a full C runtime library.

MinGW allows developers to build Windows applications using GCC while avoiding the complexities of other toolchains, making it popular for cross-compiling and porting Unix-like applications to Windows.
