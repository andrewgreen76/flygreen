in my profile : "looking to build lasting relationships with like-minded people"


What makes you stand out ? 

    I like to solve problems quickly and efficiently. I have a history of automating a lot of system-level tasks in Bash.
    
    Unlike most other people, I’m quite a bit of a people-pleaser. I like to show that in my attendance and performance. I like to show that I’m prepared for all sorts of things (even if my train of thought in that area may seem absurd to some). That means I need to be get very resourceful, but whatever the case , I just need time to familiarize myself with the environment , the various tasks , and especially people. I can read people and I calculate my priorities based on their rank , their current emotional make-up , and the current situation at work.
    
    I like to not just solve problems and help people. I like to educate on certain things, particular ways of handling issues that they can adopt themselves in the future. They don’t have to know all the technical details. The expected reaction is : “Oh, wow. That works.”
