DISK CLONING AND OS DEPLOYMENT
===================================================================================

"To deploy an OS in IT means to install, configure, and distribute an operating system onto target devices or
 servers for operational use" efficiently using a single machine, typically using disk imaging methods.


Disk imaging - basics:
 . Disk image : a copy of an application or a system but packaged as a single file. So it’s like a virtual disk.
 . Just like a disk, the image has to be mounted.
 . “disk imaging” = disk cloning
 . for CLONING MACHINES
 . to clone a machine : to make a copy of the entire operating system in the form of a disk image - as a backup
 . helps with portability


Disk imaging methods:
 !!! ALWAYS unmount ANY hard drive before you clone it; doing so will prevent r/w conflicts and data corruption. !!!
  |
 (a) disk-to-disk cloning : using an external hard drive
  | . external hard drive dock : a device for connecting multiple hard drives at once
  | . dd : a traditional Unix utility for copying and creating files
  |
 (b) network-initiated deployment
    . installing an OS via a network
       # option : default boot options built into the network
       # option : custom images
    . requires automation for deployment across multiple machines for the method to be more practical
    . It is ideal to advise your company on hardware standardization. Having hardware diversity can make your life
	a living hell when you want to deploy the same system across multiple machines. Having a single computer
	that is different from all the others means you have to learn about its drivers and maintain those drivers
	and the OS separately from the other machines. So it’s not just a case of one small difference. Your workload
	pretty much doubles.
