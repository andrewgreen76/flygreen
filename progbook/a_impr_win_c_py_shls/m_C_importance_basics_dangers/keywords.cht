No, it is not true that the C programming language has only 32 keywords. The C language has a total of 32 reserved keywords. These keywords have predefined meanings in the language and cannot be used as identifiers (such as variable names or function names). However, C also has additional standard library functions and data types that are not considered keywords.

Here is a list of the 32 reserved keywords in the C language:

c
Copy code
auto        double      int         struct
break       else        long        switch
case        enum        register    typedef
char        extern      return      union
const       float       short       unsigned
continue    for         signed      void
default     goto        sizeof      volatile
do          if          static      while
It's worth noting that the C language has evolved over time, and newer versions (such as C99 and C11) introduced additional keywords and features. However, the core set of 32 keywords remains consistent across different versions of the C language.
