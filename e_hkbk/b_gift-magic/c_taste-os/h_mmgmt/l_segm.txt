Internal fragmentation : too much free memory in an address space.

Segment : a piece of uninterrupted virtual address space.
. every segment has its own base and bounds pair
. virtual address - 14 bits (2 bits to tell the segment , 12 bits of offset) 
  . code segment
    . seg field : 00
    . grows positive : 1
    . data segment and code segment are usually lumped together as "program code" 
  . heap segment
    . seg field : 01 
    . grows positive : 1
  . stack segment
    . seg field : 11 
    . grows positive : 0
  . offset - virtual location within the context of the segment 

Segmentation :
. segments of the same address space can be populated in different places across physical memory
. this should allow the kernel populate processes that do not hold memory hostage between the stack and the heap
. MMU should have a register pair for every segment

Segmentation fault :
. attempting to access memory outside of the bounds of a segment
