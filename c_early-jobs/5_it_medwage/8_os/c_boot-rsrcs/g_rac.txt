Downloading vs. streaming :
 . downloaded data stays on the target device's disk 
 . "Streamed data is temporarily buffered in the target machine’s RAM or cache for immediate use and is
    typically discarded after being read, not permanently stored."


===================================================================================
STREAMING THE OS IMAGE - VIA A RAC INTERFACE 
===================================================================================

 . some call it "internet-based booting"

RAC (remote access controller)
 . a specialized IC on the server’s motherboard or it can be a specialized EXPANSION CARD 
 . performs REMOTE CARETAKING OF SERVERS DESPITE THEIR CONDITION
    . a.k.a. OUT-OF-BAND MANAGEMENT 
    . a RAC can collect data on / monitor the condition and resources of servers
    . can RECOVER THE POWER AND THE OS with networking functions on a server remotely 
    . can reconfigure servers
    . ex. : IPMI
    . "... a RAC can function independently, though many modern RACs integrate with or rely on the BMC
       for broader system management features." 

1. the target server must have a RAC device , like an iDRAC (on a Dell server motherboard) 
2. RAC has to be enabled in BIOS
3. through the RAC interface an OS image on a disk is to be selected
4. the OS image is then streamed to the target server , but not retained 


RAC's limits :
 . limited to aiding hardware with IPMI support
 . cannot handle physical issues with hardware
 . cannot help with certain networking accessibility issues - firewalls , DNS failures , etc.
