DISK ARMS AND THEIR MOVEMENT 
===================================================================================

"
In a hard disk drive (HDD), all the read/write arms typically move together. This synchronized movement is controlled by a mechanism known as a **voice coil actuator**. 

Here's how it works:

- When the HDD accesses data, the actuator moves all the arms simultaneously to the correct cylinder (track) across all platters. This ensures that the read/write heads on all arms align with the same track across different platters.

- While the arms are synchronized for vertical movement, the individual heads can read from or write to different sectors on their respective tracks independently once they are positioned correctly.

This design helps improve the efficiency of data access since all heads can reach their intended positions at the same time, reducing seek time and improving performance.
