CHUNK SIZE AFFECTS PERFORMANCE 
=============================================================================

 . I/O data is broken down into stripes
 . stripes are broken down into chunks
 

Stripe :
 . a group of consecutive I/O data pieces , each one written to a different disk at the same time 
 . a logical subset of I/O data 


Chunk :
 . a block , the smallest unit of I/O data
 . a logical element of a stripe , written separately to a different disk

Why is chunk size so meaningful ?
|
Imagine you want to store a small file. 
  a) you can slice it into very small chunks 
    + more disks are used (better use of parallelism) 
    + more chunks are written/accessed at the same time
    - more chunks => more head re-positioning (lift-off , rot.delay , landing on the disk) 
  b) you can split it into very large chunks 
    - fewer disks are populated at the same time
    + less re-positioning of the head 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reminder : positioning time = seek time + rotational delay.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We need to strike the right balance between small chunks and large chunks.
