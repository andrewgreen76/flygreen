No, global variables are not located on the stack. Global variables in C and C++ are typically stored in a region of memory known as the "data segment" or "global/static data segment." This segment is separate from the stack and the heap.

Here's a brief overview of the three main memory regions in a typical C or C++ program:

1. **Stack:**
   - The stack is a region of memory used for storing local variables and function call information.
   - Each function call gets its own stack frame, and local variables within a function are typically stored on the stack.
   - The stack is managed automatically by the compiler.

2. **Heap:**
   - The heap is a region of memory used for dynamic memory allocation, where objects can be allocated and deallocated at runtime using functions like `malloc` and `free` (or `new` and `delete` in C++).
   - The heap is managed manually by the programmer, and memory needs to be explicitly allocated and deallocated.

3. **Data Segment (Global/Static Data):**
   - The data segment includes both initialized and uninitialized global and static variables.
   - Global variables are declared outside of any function, making them accessible throughout the entire program.
   - Static variables (both global and local static) also reside in this segment.
   - The data segment is typically divided into initialized and uninitialized sections.

Global variables in C and C++ are usually stored in the initialized data section of the data segment. The specific layout of memory segments can vary depending on the compiler and the operating system. However, global variables are distinct from stack-allocated variables and heap-allocated variables.
