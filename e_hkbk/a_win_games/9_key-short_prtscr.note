Yes, there is often a keyboard shortcut for capturing a portion of the screen on most modern operating systems. Here are some common keyboard shortcuts for screen capture:

Windows:

    Windows key + Shift + S: This opens the Snipping Tool, which allows you to capture a portion of the screen and save it to the clipboard or a file.
    Windows key + PrtScn: This captures the entire screen and saves it as a screenshot in the "Pictures" folder.

Mac:

    Command + Shift + 4: This turns the cursor into a crosshair, which you can use to select a portion of the screen to capture. The screenshot is saved as a file on the desktop.
    Command + Shift + 3: This captures the entire screen and saves it as a file on the desktop.

Linux:

    Print Screen or PrtScn: This captures the entire screen and saves it as an image file.
    Alt + Print Screen or Alt + PrtScn: This captures the current active window and saves it as an image file.

Note that these shortcuts may vary depending on the specific operating system version and settings.
