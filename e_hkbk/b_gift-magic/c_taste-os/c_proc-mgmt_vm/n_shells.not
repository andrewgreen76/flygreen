A shell is a user-made program that performs the following :
|
Prompt : 
- shows the prompt
- waits for user input
|
Run/wait : 
- finds the program of interest						newp_args[0]
- calls fork() to run the command in a branch process 			fork()
- calls an exec..() to transform the branch into a new process		exec..()
- calls wait() in the parent for the new process to finish		wait()
- returns from wait() in the parent
|
- repeats the prompt-run cycle



Every shell session is a process.
