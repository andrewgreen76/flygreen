At room temperature boron is a hard, shiny, black-brown (almost black) brittle solid metalloid, while during high-
  -temperature diffusion doping it is vaporized into a colorless gas (typically as diborane B₂H₆ or boron tribromide
  BBr₃) that decomposes at 900–1200 °C to deposit atomic boron into the silicon lattice.
