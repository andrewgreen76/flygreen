What is the language predominantly used for coding NVidia graphics drivers? Is it C or C++?


The NVIDIA graphics drivers are predominantly written in C programming language. C is a widely used language for system-level programming and is known for its efficiency and low-level control. The NVIDIA graphics drivers interact closely with the underlying hardware and operating system, requiring direct access to system resources, memory management, and hardware-specific operations. C provides the necessary flexibility and performance required for such low-level programming tasks.

While the NVIDIA graphics drivers primarily use C, it's worth noting that other languages, such as C++ and assembly language, may also be used in certain parts of the driver stack. C++ is often utilized for higher-level abstractions, object-oriented programming, and code organization. However, the core functionality and performance-critical sections of the NVIDIA graphics drivers are typically implemented in C.
