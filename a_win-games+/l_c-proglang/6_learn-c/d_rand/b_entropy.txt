ENTROPY
===================================================================================

 . the extent of unpredictability or randomness in a system or dataset


Source of entropy:
 . "... provides unpredictable or random data that cannot be easily guessed or reproduced."
 . system time
 . hardware events (including peripherals)
 . internal noise
 . external noise
 . etc.
 

Seed value - its role and lifetime:
 . generated using sources of entropy
 . with some arbitrary algorithm
 -> fed to the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) in order to "initialize" that PRNG, bringing it to its first
    (internal) state
 . "Directly using raw entropy is often SLOW, LIMITED, and UNEVEN, so a PRNG processes it to efficiently produce
   large, high-quality sequences of random numbers."
 -> "A PRNG uses deterministic algorithms to transform its seeded internal state into a sequence of numbers that
    appear random but are reproducible if the seed is known."
 -> "Over time or after producing many numbers, the generator may be reseeded with new entropy to maintain
    unpredictability."
