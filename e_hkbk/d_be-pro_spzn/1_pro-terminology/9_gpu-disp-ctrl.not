"Another name for a graphics controller on a motherboard is a "graphics chip" or "GPU" (Graphics Processing Unit). These terms are commonly used to refer to the hardware component responsible for handling graphics processing tasks, such as rendering and displaying images, videos, and graphical user interfaces.
