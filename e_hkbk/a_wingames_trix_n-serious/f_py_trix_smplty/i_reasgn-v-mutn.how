But if you are RE-assigning to x, isn't that mutation?

Technically, it's not a mutation.

A mutation is an *in-place* change.

In other words, the value of an object changes (without changing the binding of its name). For example,
x = [1,2]
x.append(3)

Here the object bound to x is modified without unbinding the name `x`
