# Welcome to the experimental edutainment/multi-tutorial repository. 

__________________________________________________________________________
The PURPOSE of this repo:
__________________________________________________________________________

To help individuals, with or without a technical background, to:
- fill in the gaps left by their formal education or, if they didn't have any,
  provide them with comprehensive alternative education;
  - (especially for beginners)
    - hone their programming skills,
    - internalize key programming and engineering concepts,
    - learn about different systems,
    - understand and build a perspective on modern computing through studying
      its history.
- grow a portfolio; 
- improve their productivity in general (combatting ADD, figuring out
  alternatives to unhealthy solutions, etc.);

CHOSEN PROFESSIONAL PROJECT: 
__________________________________________________________________________

A legacy BIOS/UEFI (x86) -based OS :
- 32-bit
? multiboot2 -compliant ?? 
- to be tested in QEMU
- to be shipped for Raspberry Pi

CHOSEN PERSONAL PROJECT:
__________________________________________________________________________

- a game for Linux 
  - OpenGL 
  - drivers (dev's)
    - framebuffer
    - SDL mixer / ALSA 

- a game like a built-in OS

- a game for DosBox
- an emulator (VM) 
- learn BIOS-kernel-API/DSP-distro ladder for that 
- An API / display server protocol for a 13h-like mode portable to any server-like system.
