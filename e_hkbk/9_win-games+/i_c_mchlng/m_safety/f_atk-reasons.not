In the context of computer security, malicious actors refer to individuals, groups, or entities that engage in activities aimed at compromising the security of computer systems, networks, or data for their own gain or to cause harm. They are commonly referred to as hackers, attackers, or threat actors.

Malicious actors can have various motivations and objectives, including:

    Financial Gain: Some attackers engage in activities like identity theft, credit card fraud, ransomware attacks, or stealing sensitive information for financial gain.

    Espionage: State-sponsored attackers or cyber-espionage groups target organizations, governments, or individuals to gain access to confidential or classified information.

    Sabotage: Malicious actors may seek to disrupt or damage computer systems, networks, or critical infrastructure to cause disruption, chaos, or harm to individuals or organizations.

    Ideological or Political Motivations: Some attackers may target systems or organizations based on ideological or political beliefs, seeking to promote their agenda, create awareness, or cause reputational damage.

    Personal Vendettas: In some cases, individuals with personal grievances or vendettas may target specific individuals, organizations, or systems to exact revenge or cause harm.

Malicious actors employ various techniques, such as social engineering, malware, phishing, denial-of-service attacks, and exploiting vulnerabilities in software or systems, to achieve their objectives. It's essential for individuals and organizations to be vigilant, implement strong security measures, and follow best practices to protect against malicious actors and mitigate the risks associated with their activities.
