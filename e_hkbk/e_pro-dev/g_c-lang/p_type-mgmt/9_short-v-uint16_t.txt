Yes, you can use `unsigned short` instead of `uint16_t`, but there are a few considerations:

1. **Size Guarantee:** 
   - `uint16_t` is guaranteed to be exactly 16 bits (2 bytes) on all platforms. 
   - `unsigned short` may be 16 bits on most platforms but is not guaranteed; it could potentially be larger (e.g., 32 bits) on some architectures.

2. **Readability and Intent:**
   - Using `uint16_t` can make your intent clearer, as it explicitly indicates that you want a 16-bit unsigned integer. This can help with code portability and maintainability.

3. **Portability:**
   - If your code needs to be portable across different compilers and architectures, using `uint16_t` ensures that the size and behavior will be consistent.

In summary, if you specifically need a 16-bit unsigned integer and want to ensure portability and clarity, `uint16_t` is the better choice. If you are certain that `unsigned short` will always be 16 bits on your target platform and prefer a more traditional type, you can use `unsigned short`.
