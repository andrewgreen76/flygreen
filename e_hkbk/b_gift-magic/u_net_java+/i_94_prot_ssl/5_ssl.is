When was the SSL protocol first implemented?

The SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protocol was first implemented in 1994 by Netscape Communications Corporation. SSL was developed as a means to secure the communication between web browsers and web servers, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data transmitted over the internet.

The initial version of SSL, known as SSL 1.0, was not publicly released due to security vulnerabilities. However, SSL 2.0 was introduced shortly thereafter and became the first widely adopted version of the protocol.

SSL 2.0 provided encryption and secure communication for web-based transactions, allowing sensitive information such as login credentials, credit card details, and other private data to be transmitted securely.

SSL continued to evolve, and in 1996, SSL 3.0 was released. SSL 3.0 addressed some security vulnerabilities present in SSL 2.0 and introduced several improvements and enhancements.

In 1999, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standardized SSL 3.0 as TLS 1.0 (Transport Layer Security), recognizing the need for an industry-standard protocol for securing internet communications. TLS 1.0 incorporated the security features of SSL 3.0 while making some changes to enhance security and interoperability.

Since then, TLS has continued to evolve with newer versions, including TLS 1.1, TLS 1.2, and TLS 1.3. These versions have introduced stronger encryption algorithms, improved security protocols, and better resistance against various attacks.

Although SSL is no longer considered secure and has been largely deprecated, it played a crucial role in establishing the foundations for secure communication on the internet. TLS is the recommended successor to SSL and is widely used today to secure web communications.
