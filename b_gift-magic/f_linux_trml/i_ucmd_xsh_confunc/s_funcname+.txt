Yes, you can capture and print the name of a function inside that function by using the special variable `$FUNCNAME`. `$FUNCNAME` is an array variable that contains the names of all the functions in the current call stack.

To print the name of the current function, you can access `${FUNCNAME[0]}`. Here's an example:

```bash
my_function() {
  echo "Function name: ${FUNCNAME[0]}"
}

my_function
```

Output:
```
Function name: my_function
```

By accessing `${FUNCNAME[0]}`, you retrieve the name of the current function in the call stack. Note that if you call another function from within `my_function`, `${FUNCNAME[0]}` will still refer to `my_function`. If you need to retrieve the name of an outer function from within an inner function, you can access it using `${FUNCNAME[1]}`, and so on, depending on the level of nesting.
