WRITE-AHEAD LOGGING (WAL) : 
==================================================================================================================

 . alternative to the slower `fsck`
 . a very basic form of journaling   


Logging - keeping record in `struct journal` :
 . kept between a superblock and a block group somewhere in the middle of the disk
 + intended file ops
 . THAT'S IT 
   

Crash -> recovery -> outcomes using the journal : 
 (a) initial state of FS is regained
 (b) final state of FS is achieved
