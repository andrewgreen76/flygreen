INSTALLATION EXECUTABLES IN WINDOWS GUI
===================================================================================

Flavors of executables:
 (a) files that guide the GUI Windows installer (wizard) to correctly install something
      . the system assumes certain settings by default
 (b) independent custom installers, having nothing to do with an .msi file or the Windows installer and just
     running point on everything
      . you will have to define every little detail for the installation process


Microsoftâ€™s portable executable (PE):
 . a format of an executable native to Windows
 . not just code and operands
 . regular text (e.g., comments)
 . embedded raw data (say, for an image) under the resources section (.rsrc)


Microsoft install package (MSI file):
 . the MSI file is used by Windows installer to generate instructions for setting up, maintaining, and removing
   the software


Windows installer bootstrapping: 
 . the triggered PE will in turn trigger, pass its own resources, and then pass control to (bootstrap) the
   Windows installer
