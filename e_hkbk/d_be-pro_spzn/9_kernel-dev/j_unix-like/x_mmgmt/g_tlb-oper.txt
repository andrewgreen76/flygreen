How a TLB is used :
. a lot like traditional paging 
. the kernel obtains the VPN and translates it to the PFN 



TLB hit :
. a translation is present for a certain virtual address
. in that case :
  . virt.addr -> VPN -> PTEAddr -> PTE -> PTE.PFN
  . virt.addr -> offset
  . PhysAddr = (PTE.PFN << SHIFT) | offset 

.
