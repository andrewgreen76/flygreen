"
Polysilicon (polycrystalline silicon) is a material made of many small silicon crystals (grains) formed by
  depositing silicon atoms in a disordered, multi-crystalline structure onto a substrate, typically using
  chemical vapor deposition (CVD) at high temperature, and is widely used in ICs for gates, resistors, and
  interconnects.
