What is the origin of the name for the command "acpi"? 
ChatGPT

The name "acpi" stands for "Advanced Configuration and Power Interface." ACPI is an open standard that defines power management and configuration interfaces between hardware devices, operating systems, and firmware. It provides features for managing power resources, thermal management, device configuration, and more.

The "acpi" command in Linux is a user-space utility that interacts with the ACPI subsystem of the kernel to retrieve information about power and thermal devices. It allows users to access ACPI-related information and perform operations related to power management.

The term "ACPI" itself was coined as a standardized successor to older power management standards such as APM (Advanced Power Management). ACPI was developed by a consortium of companies including Intel, Microsoft, and Toshiba, among others, to provide a unified power management interface for modern computer systems.
