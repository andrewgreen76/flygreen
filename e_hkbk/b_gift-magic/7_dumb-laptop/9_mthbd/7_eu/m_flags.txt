0 (CF) - Carry Flag**: Set if an arithmetic operation resulted in a carry out of the most significant bit (carry or borrow).

1 (PF) - Parity Flag**: Set if the least significant byte of the result contains an even number of set bits.

2 (AF) - Auxiliary Carry Flag**: Set if an arithmetic operation resulted in a carry out of bit 3 (used for BCD arithmetic).

3 (ZF) - Zero Flag**: Set if the result of an arithmetic or logical operation is zero.

4 (SF) - Sign Flag**: Set if the result of an arithmetic or logical operation is negative (most significant bit set).

5 (TF) - Trap Flag**: Used for single-stepping through instructions for debugging purposes.

6 (IF) - Interrupt Enable Flag**: If set, interrupts are enabled; if clear, interrupts are disabled.

7 (DF) - Direction Flag**: Used by certain string instructions to control the direction of data movement (0 = forward, 1 = backward).

8 (OF) - Overflow Flag**: Set if an arithmetic operation resulted in signed overflow (e.g., addition resulting in a value too large to represent in signed form).

9-11 (Reserved)**: Reserved for future use.

12 (IOPL) - I/O Privilege Level Flags**: These two bits represent the current I/O privilege level when the CPU is operating in protected mode.

13 (NT) - Nested Task Flag**: Indicates whether the current task is nested within another task.

14 (RF) - Resume Flag**: Used for debugging purposes to indicate whether the processor is in resume mode.

15 (VM) - Virtual 8086 Mode Flag**: Set if the processor is in virtual 8086 mode.

16 (AC) - Alignment Check**: Set if an unaligned memory access is attempted in protected mode.

17 (VIF) - Virtual Interrupt Flag**: Used in virtual-8086 mode to indicate virtual interrupt enable.

18 (VIP) - Virtual Interrupt Pending**: Used in virtual-8086 mode to indicate pending virtual interrupt.

19 (ID) - CPUID Instruction Flag**: Indicates whether the CPU supports the CPUID instruction.

20-31 (Reserved)**: Reserved for future use.

These flags provide valuable information about the state of the processor and are frequently used by the CPU during program execution, interrupt handling, and system management.
