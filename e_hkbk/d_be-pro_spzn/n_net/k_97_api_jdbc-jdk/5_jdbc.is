What is JDBC?
ChatGPT

JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is an API (Application Programming Interface) that provides a standard way for Java applications to interact with databases. It allows Java programs to connect to and communicate with various database systems using the Java programming language.

The JDBC API provides a set of classes and interfaces that define methods and behaviors for database connectivity and database operations. It abstracts the underlying details of different databases and provides a uniform interface that developers can use to work with databases in a consistent manner.

With JDBC, developers can perform tasks such as establishing a connection to a database, executing SQL queries, retrieving and manipulating data, and managing transactions. JDBC supports a wide range of database systems, including popular ones like Oracle, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and more.

The key components of JDBC include:

    DriverManager: Provides methods to establish a database connection.

    Connection: Represents a connection to a database and allows executing SQL statements and managing transactions.

    Statement and PreparedStatement: Allows executing SQL queries and statements on the database.

    ResultSet: Represents the result of a query and provides methods to retrieve and manipulate data from the query result.

JDBC plays a crucial role in enabling Java applications to integrate with relational databases seamlessly. It provides a standardized approach for database connectivity and is widely used in Java-based applications ranging from simple desktop applications to complex enterprise systems.
