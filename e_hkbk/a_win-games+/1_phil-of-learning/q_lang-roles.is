- Programming is about the “how”. The programmer knows HOW it’s done.
- Scripting is about fulfilling wishes with ignorance on the part of the user.
- Scripting is about productivity. 

- Every machine should be able to fulfill the most basic wish imaginable ... like sending a signal, coloring a pixel.
