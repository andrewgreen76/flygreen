Single-Queue Multiprocessor Scheduling (SQMS) :
 |
 |
 . all jobs across all CPUs are lined up in one scheduling queue
 |
 . The queue has its own set of locks (one for the head , one for the tail) to be acquired one process at a time.
   -> a waiting process means high CPU utilization (non-stop use of all the registers and caches) 
   -> Bottleneck #1 : "High CPU utilization on one or more cores can create bottlenecks, slowing down the execution of processes and tasks."
   -> Bottleneck #2 : the more CPUs get lined up for the lock , the slower the system
    => tasks get moved between CPUs 



Multi-Queue Multiprocessor Scheduling (MQMS) :
 |
 . every CPU gets its own queue
