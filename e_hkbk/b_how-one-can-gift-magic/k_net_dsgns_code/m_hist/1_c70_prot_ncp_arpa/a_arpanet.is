Is ARPANET in and of itself a protocol or is it composed of protocols?
ChatGPT

ARPANET is not a single protocol but a pioneering network that served as the precursor to the modern internet. It was composed of various protocols and technologies that collectively enabled the network to function.

ARPANET was developed by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the United States Department of Defense and was operational from the late 1960s until its decommissioning in 1990. It was a research network that connected multiple host computers at universities and research institutions.

The protocols used in ARPANET included the Network Control Program (NCP), which facilitated communication between host computers, and later the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) suite, which became the standard for internet communication.

ARPANET also relied on other supporting protocols such as the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) for mapping network addresses to physical addresses, the Internet Protocol (IP) for packet routing, and the Domain Name System (DNS) for domain name resolution.

These protocols, along with others, formed the foundation of ARPANET's functionality and allowed for the exchange of data and resources between connected computers.

Therefore, ARPANET itself was not a protocol, but rather a network infrastructure that employed various protocols to enable communication and data transfer. Its success paved the way for the development of the modern internet and the widespread adoption of TCP/IP as the dominant protocol suite.
