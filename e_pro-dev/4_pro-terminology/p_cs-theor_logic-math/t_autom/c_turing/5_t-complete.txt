TURING-COMPLETE MACHINE 
===================================================================================

 . a real-world machine
 . modelled after the Turing machine - but with limitations 
 |
 . limited memory
 . just like the TM , this one can perform a variety of operations beyond arithmetic 
    . the ability to check for conditions
    . the ability to jump on a condition 
    
 . needs enough time and memory to solve any one particular problem

 . calculator
 . digital watch
 . digital thermostat
 . a vending machine
 . Coq programming language
 . Agda programming language 

"
Actually, there are many examples of Turing-incomplete machines, such as a digital watch that only tracks time, a basic thermostat, or a vending machine with a fixed set of operations. Each of these systems lacks the ability to simulate a Turing machine because they have limited functionality and do not support general-purpose computation.
