Data signal instability occurs with persistent enable or extremely high-frequency clocks due to several factors:

1. **Signal Propagation Delay**: At extremely high frequencies, the time it takes for signals to travel through the circuit (propagation delay) becomes comparable to the clock cycle. This can cause signals to arrive at destinations too late or too early, leading to race conditions or incorrect data being latched.

2. **Setup and Hold Time Violations**: Sequential circuits like flip-flops rely on certain timing conditions, including setup and hold times, to correctly latch data. If a clock or enable signal is too fast, these conditions might be violated, causing the flip-flops to latch incorrect data or fail to update altogether.

3. **Timing Skew**: With higher frequencies, small mismatches in the timing of different clock signals (or enables) across the system can result in skew, where different parts of the circuit become unsynchronized. This misalignment leads to data being processed at the wrong time, introducing instability.

4. **Power Integrity Issues**: As clock frequency increases, the power consumption spikes due to the increased switching activity in the circuits. This can cause voltage fluctuations or noise, which can further destabilize the signals.

5. **Heat Dissipation and Physical Limits**: The faster the switching, the more heat is generated in the components. At very high frequencies, thermal effects can alter the electrical properties of the circuit, leading to performance degradation and instability.

In summary, when using persistent enables or extremely high-frequency clocks, the circuit faces difficulty maintaining stable signal timing, synchronization, and data integrity, which ultimately results in instability.
