LOGIC FAMILIES
===================================================================================

"
A logic family is a group of integrated circuits that implement digital logic functions using a consistent technology,
  voltage levels, speed, power consumption, and pin compatibility (e.g., TTL or CMOS).
"


"
There are many logic families beyond TTL and CMOS, including ECL, NMOS, PMOS, BiCMOS, and GaAs, each optimized for
  specific speed, power, or application needs.

MAINSTREAM LOGIC FAMILIES
===================================================================================

Low-power Schottky TTL family:
 . TTL = transistor-transistor logic
 . a.k.a. LS TTL
 . uses BJTs
 . "for faster switching speeds (around 9 ns) at moderate power (1–2 mW per gate)"


High-speed CMOS family:
 . CMOS = Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor
 . a.k.a. HC
 . uses MOSFETs
 . "for lower power consumption (0.1–0.5 mW per gate at 100 kHz) with comparable speed (8–10 ns at 5 V)
 . better noise immunity"
