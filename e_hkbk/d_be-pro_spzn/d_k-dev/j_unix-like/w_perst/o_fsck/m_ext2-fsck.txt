EXT2 : 
===========================================================================================

ext2 :
 . released in 1993 
 . used `fsck` for retaining/maintaining FS stability 
 . S-block holds the [MOUNT STATE] of the file system 
    . EXT2_VALID_FS - macro for "trustworthy" ; all changes are finalized and consistent 
 . precursor to ext3 (w/ the journaling mechanism) 

===========================================================================================
FSCK - FILE SYSTEM CONSISTENCY CHECKER 
===========================================================================================

 . S-blocks' corruptions 
    . compares the FS size to the num of alloc'd blocks 
 . reconciliation b/w bitmaps and inodes 
 . reconciliation of inode types  
 . dir entries
 . link counts
 . defective duplicates
 . dangling dir/block pointers (elimination) 
 . out-of-bounds pointers
    . located in inodes and indirect blocks 
    . pointers with addresses out of founds of the partition
 . 2-to-1 dir links 

  +---------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | . used in legacy file systems					|
  +---------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | - runs at a slow rate						|
  | - scans the entire drive even if the issues are few			|
  |    - got worse with larger disk capacities and integration of RAID	|
  |    => inefficient							|
  | => can take hours							|
  +---------------------------------------------------------------------+

 . reboot -> FS is mounted and ready -> [fsck]
