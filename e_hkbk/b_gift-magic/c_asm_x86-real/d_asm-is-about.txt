We can't understand the nature and purpose of the assembly language without discussing the following :
 |
 . abstraction (software taking care of things for you) vs. implementation (personally written instructions) 
 . legacy platforms - old tools and systems 
 . platform specifications (requirements) - the only things the system will work with 
 . compatibility modes , backwards compatibility
 . memory management , process memory layout
 . CPU control handover between the OS kernel and the subordinate process
