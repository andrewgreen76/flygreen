Three ways of achieving things:
 |
 . The Jensen Huang way: "I have plenty of time, I don't plan ahead."
 . The Steve Jobs way: "I don't have time. I will get things done today no matter what it takes."
 |
 . The third way:
    . Break out of the loop of bad habits, especially when it comes to finding and settling into a job. 
    . 15-min meditations / doing absolutely nothing.
    . Negotiate with the noisy self - see a big change can do in your life, not a small change.
    . Seek ways to improve your life. You hate your job? Don't quit yet but do find a better job.
    . Find a community that will support you.
    . Focus on the things that bring you joy.
    . Mind the room for growth at your job or the desired job and the ceiling to your growth at those jobs.
