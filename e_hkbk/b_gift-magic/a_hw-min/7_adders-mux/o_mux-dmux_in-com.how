Mux and DMux in comm networks :

- Information can be sent in a serial line of 0's and 1's from the Mux at the source to the DMux at the destination.
  The sel at each of those components is connected to a clocking device called the oscillator. The oscillator keeps
  feeding an alternating pattern of 0's and 1's to sel. This way a bit will be popped off of one channel and then
  another channel, then another channel, and then another channel, and so on. This way the digital data keeps getting
  driven to the destination bit by bit, later pushed to the outputs in an alternating fashion bit by bit.

  - This way a stream of data on the same input to the Mux at source can be delivered concurrently with another stream
    of data on a different input channel down the communication line in the middle in a serial and alternating fashion
    to the DMux at the destination. The DMux will use its own clock to undo the braided stream and send the unwound data
    down the output channel where it was intended.
