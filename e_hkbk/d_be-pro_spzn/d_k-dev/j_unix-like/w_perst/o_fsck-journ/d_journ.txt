=========================================================================================

 . a.k.a. write-ahead logging


Premise :
 |
 . LOG impending write-ops in the [JOURNAL STRUCTURE] on the disk
    . the journal structure is typically squeezed between the S-block and i-bitmap
 . STORE state of target blocks 
 . DATA INTEGRITY :
    . MORE IMPORTANT THAN FIGHTING FOR UPDATES 
    . after a crash/outage and a reboot the OS will decide whether to ...
       . revert (roll back) the changes -or-
       . re-enact (replay) the changes 


History of use : 
 . introduced with the release of the ext3 Linux file system
 . in 2001 
 . still used in modern systems 


Pros / cons : 
 + targets recovery point => faster recovery 
 - as an update phase, journaling increases update completion time
