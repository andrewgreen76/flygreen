The choice of programming style, whether procedural or functional, is not inherently tied to a specific programming language. Both C and JavaScript can be used to write code in either style.

However, it's worth noting that different programming languages have different strengths and paradigms that align well with certain programming styles. For example:

- C is a procedural programming language that provides low-level control over the hardware and memory. It is commonly used for systems programming, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications. The procedural style, with its emphasis on step-by-step instructions and mutable state, aligns well with C's imperative nature.

- JavaScript is a versatile language that supports multiple paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. JavaScript's functional capabilities, such as higher-order functions and first-class functions, make it well-suited for functional programming. Many JavaScript libraries and frameworks also encourage a functional programming style.

Ultimately, the choice of programming style depends on various factors, including the nature of the problem you are solving, the requirements of the project, the language features and libraries available, and personal preferences. It's important to understand the strengths and limitations of different programming styles and choose the one that best suits your needs and the goals of your project.
