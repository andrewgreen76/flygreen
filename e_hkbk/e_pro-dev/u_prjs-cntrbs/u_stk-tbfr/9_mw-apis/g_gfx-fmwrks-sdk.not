Yes, there are several graphics frameworks and libraries available for rasterizing fonts and graphics in an x64 Linux system. Here are a few popular options:

1. Cairo: Cairo is a 2D graphics library that provides powerful rendering capabilities, including font handling and graphics rendering. It supports various output backends, including X Window System, PDF, SVG, and more. Cairo offers high-quality rendering and advanced features like anti-aliasing, alpha blending, and gradient fills.

2. FreeType: FreeType is a widely-used open-source font rasterization library. It supports various font formats and provides advanced font rendering capabilities. FreeType allows developers to load, render, and manipulate fonts in raster format, making it suitable for text rendering in graphics applications.

3. SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer): SDL is a cross-platform multimedia library that provides low-level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, and graphics. SDL can be used for font rendering and basic graphics operations. It simplifies window creation, event handling, and rendering tasks and is widely used in game development and multimedia applications.

4. Pango: Pango is a library for text layout and rendering. It provides advanced text handling capabilities, including font selection, shaping, and rendering. Pango is often used in conjunction with Cairo to handle complex text layout and rendering scenarios in applications.

5. Skia: Skia is a 2D graphics library developed by Google. It provides a comprehensive set of drawing primitives, including font rendering, image manipulation, and path drawing. Skia is known for its high-performance rendering capabilities and is used extensively in Google Chrome and Android.

These frameworks and libraries offer various levels of functionality, performance, and flexibility. They can be used to render fonts, handle graphics operations, and create rich visual experiences in Linux applications. The choice of framework depends on the specific requirements of your project, such as the desired level of control, performance needs, and integration with other libraries or frameworks.
