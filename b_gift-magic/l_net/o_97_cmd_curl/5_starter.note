To access a CLI-only website, you can use the curl command. curl is a command-line tool that allows you to transfer data to or from a server using various protocols, including HTTP.

Here's an example of how to use curl to access a CLI-only website:

arduino

curl http://example.com

This command will send an HTTP request to the website at http://example.com and print the response to the terminal. You can replace http://example.com with the URL of the CLI-only website you want to access.

Note that some CLI-only websites may require authentication or other parameters to be passed in the request. In such cases, you may need to consult the website's documentation or contact the website's administrator for guidance on how to use curl to access the website.
