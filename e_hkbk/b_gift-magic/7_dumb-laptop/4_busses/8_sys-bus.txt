The ISA bus, or Industry Standard Architecture bus, was a computer bus standard introduced by IBM in 1981 for connecting peripheral devices to the motherboard of IBM PC compatible computers.

"
The ISA bus was gradually replaced by newer bus standards such as PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect) and later PCI Express (PCIe), which offered faster data transfer rates, improved performance, and more advanced features compared to ISA.

"
One key physical difference between the ISA bus and the PCIe bus is the number of electrical contacts (or pins) present on their respective connectors. The ISA bus typically used a 62-pin connector, while PCIe uses a larger number of pins for improved data transfer rates and functionality.

"
Each pin on the connector of both the ISA bus and PCIe bus represents a specific electrical connection or signal line used for communication between the motherboard and peripheral devices, such as data transfer, addressing, control signals, and power distribution.

PCIe connectors can have various configurations depending on the number of lanes (x1, x4, x8, x16, etc.), but a common PCIe x16 configuration, which is often used for graphics cards, can have over 100 pins. The exact pinout for PCIe connectors can vary depending on the version and specific implementation, but some of the key pins typically include power pins (3.3V, 12V, and ground), differential pairs for data lanes, clock signals, and various control and configuration pins. For a detailed list of all PCIe bus pins, you would need to refer to the official PCIe specification documents provided by the PCI-SIG (PCI Special Interest Group).
