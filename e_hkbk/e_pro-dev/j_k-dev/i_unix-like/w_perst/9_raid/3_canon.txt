RAID INTERFACE :
===================================================================================

 . RAID as a logical device connects with a host (file system or a client) 
 |  . usually via SATA 
 |
 . treated as a single disk (transparency)
 |  . a linear array of blocks
 |  
 . storing the same piece of data to N disks means : 
    . issuing N physical I/O requests
    . i.e., one logical I/O request 

===================================================================================
HARDWARE-BASED RAID INTERNALS : 
===================================================================================

Hardware-based RAID :
 . independent from the host's CPU

 > multiple disks + connectors 
 > RAID controller(s) ("processor(s)") : 
   . firmware runs RAID
   . performs RAID operations all on its own 
 > VM (DRAM) - for temporary buffering of I/O data 
 > NVM (SSD) - for secure buffering when writing data 

===================================================================================
SOFTWARE-BASED RAID INTERNALS : 
===================================================================================
 
Software-based RAID :
 . RAID-related operations are performed by the host's CPU 

 > multiple disks + connectors 
 > VM (DRAM) - for temporary buffering of I/O data 
 > NVM (SSD) - for secure buffering when writing data
