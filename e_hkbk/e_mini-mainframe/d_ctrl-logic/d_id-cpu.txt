Here are the typical steps involved in the identification of the CPU model and manufacturer during the POST BIOS routine:

1. Reading CPUID information: The BIOS reads the CPUID instruction, which provides detailed information about the CPU.
2. Parsing CPUID data: The BIOS parses the CPUID data to extract information such as the CPU family, model, stepping, and features.
3. Vendor identification: The BIOS checks vendor-specific signatures or identifiers to determine the CPU manufacturer (e.g., Intel or AMD).
4. Cross-referencing with microcode: The BIOS cross-references the extracted CPU information with its internal database of supported CPUs and microcode updates.
5. Displaying CPU information: The BIOS may display the detected CPU model and manufacturer on the screen during the boot process.

These steps may vary slightly depending on the specific BIOS implementation and CPU architecture.
