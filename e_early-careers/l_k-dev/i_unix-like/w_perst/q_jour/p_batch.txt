BATCHING - FOR WRITE-TO-DISK OPTIMIZATION
=================================================================================

 (a) we can run write-ops on blocks one by one
 
 (b) we can batch and log them altogether into a single global transaction
      |
      . WHY : 
      |  + metadata for one transaction instead of many
      |	 + costly read/write operations of one transaction instead of many 
      |
      . HOW :
       	 1/2 - [write-ops] , [changes to bitmaps , inodes] are collectively buffered (batched) in RAM
       	 2/2 - logged into the journal every 5 secs
