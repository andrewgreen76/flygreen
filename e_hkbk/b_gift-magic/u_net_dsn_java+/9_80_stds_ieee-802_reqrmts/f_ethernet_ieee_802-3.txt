What are IEEE 802 and IEEE 803?
ChatGPT

IEEE 802 and IEEE 803 are standards developed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) for networking technologies.

IEEE 802: The IEEE 802 standard is a family of standards that defines the specifications for local area networks (LANs) and metropolitan area networks (MANs). It covers various aspects of network operations, including physical layer specifications, data link layer protocols, network layer protocols, and higher-level network services. Some well-known standards within the IEEE 802 family include:

    IEEE 802.3: Ethernet, which defines the specifications for wired Ethernet networks.
    IEEE 802.11: Wi-Fi, which defines the specifications for wireless local area networks (WLANs).
    IEEE 802.15: Bluetooth, which defines the specifications for short-range wireless communication.
    IEEE 802.16: WiMAX, which defines the specifications for broadband wireless access.

IEEE 803: There is no specific IEEE 803 standard. The numbering scheme used by the IEEE typically reserves certain blocks of numbers for future use, so it is possible that IEEE 803 has not been assigned to a specific standard or technology at this time.
