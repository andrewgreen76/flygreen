One would believe that it makes perfect sense for educational institutions to be funded by the government for their payroll and expenses to be covered. However, ripping off the problem of out-of-pocket education like a band-aid can leave a bad rash: the US government is neither ready nor willing to upset the status quo. Putting trillions if not billions of dollars from the net tax revenue into something as costly as education would mean having very little, if anything, to spend on government payroll, parks and recreation, and essentials such as law enforcement, fireman services, and construction and maintenance projects.

						      First, let's lend our focus to a painfully obvious example of technology making no negative impact on our ability to solve problems - the design and deployment of the assembly line. Ever since the foundation of the Portsmouth Block Mills in the United Kingdom, the utilization of the assembly line reaped enormous benefits in the ways of human productivity at no cost to human intellect. The concept is simple : whatever the end goal, the production is expedited through the use of mechanical machinery. If you are an unskilled laborer in a distribution center for a bookstore, ... .

						      while it may be important for us to have a way of solving a problem, it does not necessarily have to be memorized and mechanically executed ; being able to do the same complicated thing over and over is a rather moot point to make , a dull task to repeat, and the sort of thing that can be easily documented for later examination.

	Taking the bait of responding to this amusingly ambiguous claim, we can safely say that there is little to no correlation between leveraging technology and losing our ability to apply ourselves intellectually when it comes to solving problems. The collective strength of will of the human species took us so far that the author of this writing is not willing to entertain even the slightest notion of how adoption and refinement of scientific advancements have taken intellectual potential away from us. It must be noted that very little thought was put into composing the profferred claim; therefore, the author of this essay refuses to acknowledge any possible complexities of the subject matter. And now, with all that said, below are a few ways for us to be convinced that nothing subtracts from our independent problem-solving faculties in our engagement with technology.
