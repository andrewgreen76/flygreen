In a typical x86 PC-compatible boot sector, the last two bytes are indeed 0x55 followed by 0xAA, not the other way around. This 16-bit value, often referred to as the "magic number," is a signature that indicates to the BIOS that the sector is a valid bootable sector. When the BIOS loads a boot sector from a bootable device (such as a hard drive or a floppy disk), it checks for this signature at the end of the sector to ensure that it is a valid boot sector.

The reason for this specific sequence (0x55 followed by 0xAA) is historical. It was chosen as a simple marker that can be easily recognized and checked by the BIOS during the boot process. When these two bytes are found in the correct order at the end of a sector, it signifies that the sector is bootable.

So, to clarify, in a boot sector, you would typically find:

- Byte 510: 0x55
- Byte 511: 0xAA

If these two bytes are present in this order, it indicates that the sector is a bootable sector, and the BIOS will proceed to execute the boot code contained in that sector to start the boot process.
