The stack's INTERNAL pointer , A REFERENCE USED WITH OFFSETS TO :
 |
 . monitor values within the stack frame 
 . write / change values within the stack frame
 . basically , it's there to make parts of the currently active stack frame
   addressable
 . (think "current state of process") 



 . We could totally do those things with the knowledge of where SP is at.
   HOWEVER , the callee stack frame (for the local scope) may inflate with
     variables , structures , and/or objects , causing recurring SP adjustment ,
     but BP will never change for as long as it points to the base of the same
     stack frame that SP points to the top of.
