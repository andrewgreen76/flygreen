Certainly! Here are some examples of middleware drivers commonly used in software systems:

1. Display Server Driver: Display server drivers sit between the kernel drivers and user-space applications in a graphics stack. They provide a middleware layer that abstracts the low-level details of hardware-specific graphics drivers and provides a standardized interface for user-space applications to interact with the display system. Examples include X.Org Server (used in X11 windowing system) and Wayland compositor.

2. File System Driver: File system drivers provide a middleware layer between the operating system's kernel and the user-space file system interface. They abstract the underlying file system details and provide a standardized interface for accessing and manipulating files and directories. Examples include the Ext4 driver for the Ext4 file system, the NTFS driver for the NTFS file system used in Windows, and the HFS+ driver for the HFS+ file system used in macOS.

4. Database Drivers: Database drivers sit between the application and the database management system (DBMS) and provide a middleware layer for interacting with the database. They handle tasks such as establishing connections, executing queries, and retrieving results. Examples include JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) drivers, ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) drivers, and ADO.NET drivers.

5. Input/Output (I/O) Middleware Drivers: I/O middleware drivers provide an abstraction layer for handling input and output operations, such as reading from or writing to files, network communication, and inter-process communication. They often provide higher-level APIs or libraries that simplify I/O operations and provide additional functionality. Examples include the C standard I/O library (stdio), Boost.Asio for asynchronous I/O, and libcurl for HTTP/FTP communication.

These examples represent some commonly encountered middleware drivers in software systems. The purpose of middleware drivers is to abstract lower-level hardware-specific details, provide a standardized interface, and offer additional functionality or convenience to applications or frameworks built on top of them.
