FPGA : 
 + can be REPROGRAMMED to do anything (especially greater and more complex things)
 - AT THE COST OF space, power, and performance
 |
 . the internal behavior is mainly SOFTWARE LOGIC 


ASIC - smaller transistor count
 + the design will most likely TAKE UP LESS SPACE than an FPGA
 + the circuitry is hardwired
 => MORE POWER-EFFICIENT AND PERFORMANT than an FPGA 
 - circuit logic is hardwired in a fabhouse => once programmed , it CANNOT BE REPROGRAMMED
 |
 . the internal behavior is just HARDWARE LOGIC

"
The key benefit of an ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) over an FPGA is its optimized performance, power efficiency, and smaller size for a specific task, as it is custom-designed, whereas an FPGA offers reconfigurability but is less efficient in power and speed for fixed applications.
