Identifiers (tokens such as variable names, function names, etc.) in C and C++ that start with an underscore (`_`) or two consecutive underscores (`__`) are typically reserved for use by the implementation (compiler and standard library). These naming conventions help prevent conflicts between user-defined identifiers and those used internally by the compiler or standard library.

1. **Single Underscore (`_`):**
   - Identifiers starting with a single underscore at the global scope are reserved for use by the implementation (e.g., the compiler and standard library). Users should avoid creating global identifiers starting with a single underscore to prevent naming conflicts with implementation-defined names.

2. **Double Underscore (`__`):**
   - Identifiers starting with two consecutive underscores are reserved for both the implementation and the standard library. They are typically used for implementation-defined names or macros. Users should not use identifiers starting with `__` to avoid conflicts with compiler-specific or standard library features.

It's important for developers to follow these naming conventions to ensure portability and avoid unintended clashes with implementation-specific identifiers. The C and C++ standards provide a set of rules for naming to maintain a clear distinction between user code and implementation specifics.

For example, the C standard (ISO/IEC 9899) states in Section 7.1.3:

> All identifiers that begin with an underscore and either an uppercase letter or another underscore are always reserved for any use.

Developers should refer to the specific documentation of the compiler they are using for information about reserved identifiers and naming conventions. Additionally, using meaningful and descriptive names for user-defined identifiers is considered good practice to enhance code readability and maintainability.
