Why is it important to keep spaces out of alias and variable definitions before and after the "=" sign?
ChatGPT

In Bash, when defining aliases or variables, it is important to avoid spaces before and after the "=" sign. This is because spaces are significant in Bash and they are used to separate command arguments and components.

When defining an alias or variable, any spaces around the "=" sign will be treated as part of the name or value. For example, consider the following incorrect alias definition:

bash

alias my_alias = 'ls'

In this case, Bash will interpret "my_alias " (with a space) as the alias name and "= 'ls'" as part of the command to be aliased. This will result in an error when trying to use the alias.

To define an alias or variable correctly, you should omit the spaces around the "=" sign, like this:

bash

alias my_alias='ls'

By removing the spaces, Bash will correctly interpret "my_alias" as the alias name and "'ls'" as the command to be aliased.

Similarly, when defining variables, such as:

bash

my_var = "Hello"

The spaces around the "=" sign will be treated as part of the variable name or value. To define the variable correctly, you should remove the spaces:

bash

my_var="Hello"

By following this convention, you ensure that the alias or variable definitions are properly recognized by the Bash shell.
