Yes, many modern gaming platforms use System-on-Chip (SoC) designs. SoC refers to integrated circuits that incorporate multiple components, including a processor (CPU), graphics processing unit (GPU), memory, and other essential components, onto a single chip. This integration allows for compact and power-efficient designs, making SoCs a popular choice for a wide range of devices, including gaming platforms.

Several gaming platforms that use SoCs include:

1. **Consoles:**
   - **Nintendo Switch:** The Nintendo Switch gaming console uses an SoC that combines a custom NVIDIA Tegra processor with both CPU and GPU components. This design allows the Switch to function as both a handheld device and a home console.

2. **Handheld Gaming Devices:**
   - **PlayStation Vita:** The PlayStation Vita handheld gaming device utilizes an SoC that combines CPU and GPU components to deliver gaming experiences on a portable platform.
   - **Nintendo 3DS:** The Nintendo 3DS handheld gaming console features an SoC that integrates the necessary components for 3D graphics and gaming.

3. **Mobile Gaming Devices:**
   - **Smartphones and Tablets:** Many smartphones and tablets designed for gaming feature SoCs that include powerful CPUs and GPUs to deliver high-quality gaming experiences on mobile devices.

4. **Embedded Gaming Systems:**
   - **Retro Gaming Consoles:** Some retro gaming consoles, such as the NES Classic Edition and SNES Classic Edition by Nintendo, use SoCs to emulate classic games.

SoCs are versatile and power-efficient solutions that offer a balance between performance, power consumption, and space constraints. They are well-suited for gaming platforms that prioritize portability, efficiency, and integrated capabilities. As technology advances, SoCs continue to play a significant role in shaping the gaming experiences across various devices.
