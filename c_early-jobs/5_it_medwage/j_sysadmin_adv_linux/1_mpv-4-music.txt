I want a Bash command that would launch an application that could play and mp3 file. Can you help me with that?

Certainly! You can use the mpv command-line media player to play an MP3 file. Here's an example of a Bash command that launches mpv to play an MP3 file:

bash

mpv /path/to/file.mp3

Replace /path/to/file.mp3 with the actual path to your MP3 file. Running this command will open the mpv player and start playing the specified MP3 file.

Note: Make sure you have mpv installed on your system before running this command. You can typically install it using your package manager.
