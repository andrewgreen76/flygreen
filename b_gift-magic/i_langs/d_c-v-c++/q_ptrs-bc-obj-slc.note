By using an array of pointers to Shape objects, we can store objects of derived classes such as Circle and Rectangle in the same array. This allows us to achieve polymorphic behavior, where the appropriate function implementation is determined dynamically at runtime based on the actual type of the object being pointed to. If we had used an array of Shape objects directly, the function calls would be statically bound, and the specific derived class implementations would not be invoked.
