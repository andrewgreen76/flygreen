- A process, once having issued an I/O request, will be busy with that request until done, then go back to the CPU.
- For greater efficiency allow another process to take advantage of the CPU. 



The job of the scheduler : 
. to decide when to allow for an I/O request
. to determine when the I/O request is fulfilled
  . the timer-interrupt is used for the job (think time-out)
