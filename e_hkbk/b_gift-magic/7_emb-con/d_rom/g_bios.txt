Yes, there are various development boards and platforms that allow for BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) or firmware development. However, writing a BIOS involves several complexities and considerations, as it's a critical component responsible for initializing hardware and facilitating communication between the operating system and the system's hardware.

Here are a few options:

1. **Intel Galileo/Edison or MinnowBoard:**
   - These are x86-based development boards that can run Linux and are capable of BIOS/firmware development.

2. **Raspberry Pi:**
   - While Raspberry Pi boards use ARM architecture and may not traditionally have a BIOS, they do have a firmware/bootloader called "NOOBS" or "U-Boot," which can be modified for specific purposes.

3. **BeagleBone Black:**
   - The BeagleBone Black is another ARM-based board that can be used for firmware development.

4. **STM32 Discovery or Nucleo Boards:**
   - STM32 microcontroller development boards can be used for firmware development. While they might not be traditional BIOS targets, they are suitable for firmware development and low-level system programming.

5. **UP Board or other x86 SBCs (Single Board Computers):**
   - Some x86-based single board computers provide the flexibility for BIOS or firmware development.

6. **Custom Embedded Systems:**
   - For more specific or custom requirements, designing a custom embedded system using microcontrollers or FPGAs could be an option.

It's important to note that writing a BIOS involves in-depth knowledge of hardware, low-level programming, and adherence to platform-specific standards. Additionally, many modern systems use UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) instead of traditional BIOS, which adds another layer of complexity.

Ensure that you understand the legal implications and requirements for developing firmware for specific platforms, as writing or modifying firmware often involves adherence to licensing agreements and legal considerations. Always refer to the documentation and resources provided by the board manufacturer for specific guidelines on firmware development.
