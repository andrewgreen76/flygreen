MODES : 
========================================================================================


Yes, ARM architecture has different operating modes that dictate the behavior and capabilities of the processor. The ARM architecture features several modes, each designed for specific purposes. Some of the common modes in ARM architecture include:

1. **User Mode (USR):** The default mode when the processor is executing user applications.

2. **Supervisor Mode (SVC):** Entered when the processor switches to a privileged level to execute operating system (kernel) tasks.

3. **Abort Mode (ABT):** Entered when a data or instruction prefetch abort occurs.

4. **Undefined Mode (UND):** Entered when the processor encounters an undefined instruction.

5. **System Mode (SYS):** Entered during exception processing, allowing the operating system to perform system-level tasks.

6. **IRQ Mode (IRQ):** Entered when handling Interrupt Requests.

7. **FIQ Mode (FIQ):** Entered when handling Fast Interrupt Requests.

The ARM processor switches between these modes based on certain events, exceptions, or instructions. Each mode has its set of registers, privileges, and behavior. The ability to switch between modes allows ARM processors to efficiently handle various tasks, including user applications, system-level operations, and interrupt handling. The specific modes available may vary depending on the ARM architecture version and implementation.
