WHY DIFFERENT TYPES OF TRANSISTORS?
===================================================================================
"
Different kinds of transistors exist to optimize for specific applications, such as
 . high-speed switching (BJTs),
 . low-power amplification (MOSFETs),
 . high-frequency operation (RF transistors), or
 . ruggedness in power control (IGBTs),
each leveraging variations in structure, materials, and doping.

"
Ruggedness in power control refers to a transistor's ability to withstand high voltage spikes, current surges,
  thermal stress, and short-circuit conditions without failure, ensuring reliable operation in demanding power
  electronics applications like motor drives and inverters.
