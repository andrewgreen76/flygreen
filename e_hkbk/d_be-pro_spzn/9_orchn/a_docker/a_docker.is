Docker is an open-source platform that enables the development, deployment, and running of applications using containerization. It provides a way to package software and its dependencies into a standardized unit called a container. Containers are lightweight, isolated environments that include everything needed to run an application, such as the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings.

With Docker, developers can create containers that encapsulate their applications and dependencies, ensuring consistency across different environments. Containers are portable and can run on any system that has Docker installed, regardless of the underlying operating system or infrastructure. Docker simplifies the process of deploying applications by providing a consistent runtime environment and eliminating the need to worry about dependencies or compatibility issues.

Docker also offers features like container networking, storage management, and orchestration capabilities through tools like Docker Compose and Docker Swarm. These features enable the management and scaling of containerized applications across multiple hosts or a cluster of machines.

Overall, Docker revolutionized the way applications are packaged, deployed, and scaled by leveraging containerization technology to provide a lightweight and portable solution for software development and deployment.
