VMware employs various virtualization techniques, and its flagship virtualization platform, VMware vSphere, primarily uses hardware-assisted full virtualization. This means that it leverages hardware virtualization extensions like Intel VT-x or AMD-V to enable efficient virtualization of the CPU, memory, and I/O operations.

In hardware-assisted full virtualization, VMware's hypervisor (ESXi) runs directly on the physical hardware and provides a virtualization layer that allows multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run concurrently on the same server. Each VM can run its own guest operating system, and the hypervisor ensures that the VMs are isolated from one another and from the underlying physical hardware.

VMware also supports other virtualization techniques, including:

1. **Paravirtualization**: VMware offers the option of using paravirtualization for certain guest operating systems. Paravirtualization requires modifying the guest operating system to work more efficiently with the hypervisor, resulting in improved performance compared to full virtualization in some scenarios.

2. **Hardware-Assisted GPU Virtualization**: VMware supports hardware-assisted GPU virtualization, allowing VMs to directly access the physical GPU for improved graphics performance in virtualized environments.

3. **Nested Virtualization**: VMware also allows nested virtualization, where you can run virtual machines inside a VM. This feature is useful for testing and development scenarios.

VMware provides a wide range of virtualization products, including VMware Workstation (for desktop virtualization), VMware Fusion (for macOS virtualization), and VMware vSphere (for server virtualization in data centers). Each product may offer different virtualization features and options tailored to specific use cases and environments.
