Batch processing is a method of running multiple jobs on a computer system sequentially, without manual intervention. Jobs are collected, grouped, and processed as a batch. Here are the key characteristics and components of batch processing:

1. **Job Collection**: Users or systems submit multiple jobs to be executed. These jobs might include tasks such as data processing, calculations, or file management.

2. **Job Scheduling**: The batch processing system schedules these jobs based on certain criteria, such as priority, resource availability, or dependencies between tasks.

3. **Sequential Execution**: Jobs are executed one after the other in a predetermined order. The system processes each job entirely before moving on to the next one.

4. **Automation**: Once a batch job starts, it runs to completion without further human intervention. This automation can include error handling and job logging.

5. **Efficiency**: Batch processing is efficient for tasks that require substantial computation or large volumes of data, as it maximizes the use of system resources and minimizes downtime.

6. **Historical Context**: Batch processing was particularly important in the early days of computing when interactive computing was not feasible. Users would submit jobs on punch cards or magnetic tapes, which were then processed by the computer system in batches.

**Example Scenario**: 
In a financial institution, batch processing might be used for end-of-day processing. Transactions collected throughout the day are processed in a batch after business hours, updating account balances, generating reports, and performing backups without user intervention.

Batch processing remains relevant today for tasks that can be automated and scheduled, such as data analysis, report generation, and large-scale data migrations.
