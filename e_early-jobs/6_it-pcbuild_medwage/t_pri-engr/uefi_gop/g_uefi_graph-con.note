Does UEFI use a windowing system?
ChatGPT

UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) is a firmware interface that replaces the traditional BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) firmware interface on modern PCs. It provides a standardized way for booting and initializing hardware and software components during the startup process of a computer.

UEFI itself does not include a windowing system. However, UEFI can provide support for graphical user interfaces (GUIs) through its graphical console feature. The graphical console allows UEFI firmware to display text and graphics on the screen in a graphical mode, rather than just the traditional text-based mode.

Some UEFI implementations provide a full graphical user interface (GUI) that can be used to configure system settings and perform other tasks. This GUI is typically called a "UEFI setup utility" or "UEFI firmware configuration utility" and is often accessed by pressing a specific key during the computer's startup process.

In summary, while UEFI itself does not include a windowing system, it does provide support for graphical user interfaces through its graphical console feature, and some UEFI implementations provide a full graphical user interface for system configuration.
