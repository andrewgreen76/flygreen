Is there a Bash command for printing information about where in my machine's memory things like the BIOS, the kernel, the framebuffer, etc. are?

Yes, there are several Bash commands you can use to obtain information about various hardware and system components on your machine. Here are a few commands that can provide such information:

    dmidecode: This command is used to retrieve information from the system BIOS or UEFI firmware. It can display details about the hardware, including the BIOS version, manufacturer, serial number, etc. However, it requires root privileges to access the BIOS information.

    uname: This command provides information about the kernel and operating system. For example, running uname -a will display detailed information about the kernel version, architecture, and other system details.

    lspci: This command lists information about PCI devices connected to your system. It displays details such as the vendor name, device ID, driver in use, and more.

    lsusb: This command lists information about USB devices connected to your system. It provides details such as the device ID, vendor ID, product name, and more.

    /proc: The /proc directory contains various system and process-related information. You can explore specific files within /proc to obtain details about system components. For example:
        /proc/cpuinfo: Displays information about the CPU(s) on your system.
        /proc/meminfo: Provides information about memory usage and allocation.
        /proc/mounts: Lists the currently mounted filesystems.

These commands provide different levels of information about various hardware and system components. You can explore their outputs and options to obtain specific details about the components you're interested in. Additionally, some commands may require root privileges to access certain system information.
