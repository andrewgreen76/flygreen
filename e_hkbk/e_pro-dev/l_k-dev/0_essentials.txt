WHAT IS AN OPERATING SYSTEM ? 
========================================================================================

 . NOT a program
 . it is a software suite comprised of :
   . the kernel - itself being a program 
   . build utilities : 
     . compiler
     . assembler
     . linker 
   . other utilities : 
     . debugger 


========================================================================================
WHAT IS A KERNEL ? 
========================================================================================

 . the central program of an operating system 
 . in charge of :
   . virtualizing concurrent execution of multiple jobs/tasks at the same time 
   . has to use a scheduling algorithm to figure out when to start or resume running a task amidst other tasks
   . minimizing idling time , thereby maximizing efficiency / use of resources 
   . security : has to determine whether a process is malicious or not 


========================================================================================
WHAT IS A JOB ? 
========================================================================================

 . a.k.a. a task
 |
 . a queued program
 . a user request 


========================================================================================
WHAT IS A PROCESS ? 
========================================================================================

 . a program currently being run
 . oddly enough , even when in waiting (queued) or ready state , it may still be called a process
