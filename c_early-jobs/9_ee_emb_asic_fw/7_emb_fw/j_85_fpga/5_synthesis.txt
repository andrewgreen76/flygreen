Goal : to program the behavior of a chip like an FPGA. 

	   written HDL code
	-> [synthesis tool (software) , producing and optimizing] -> a "netlist" of gates and flip-flops
	-> [synthesis tool (software) , mapping/assigning parts] -> configuration bitstream 
	-> [programmer interface]
	    . sending the configuration bitstream to target's config memory 
	    . controlling signals on target HW
	    . achieving states of CLBs (configurable logic blocks) , interconnects , and memory elements 

"
Mapping a netlist to logic blocks means assigning the interconnected logic gates and flip-flops from the netlist to the configurable logic blocks (CLBs) and other resources of an FPGA or ASIC, optimizing for timing, area, and power to implement the desired hardware functionality.
