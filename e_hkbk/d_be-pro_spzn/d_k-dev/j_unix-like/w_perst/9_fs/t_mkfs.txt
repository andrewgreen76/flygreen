MAKING AN (empty) FILESYSTEM :
========================================================================================================

File system (tree) :
 |
 . has a certain type (ext3 , NTFS) 
 . maintained on a storage device
    . It can be said that the "partition is mounted as a root file system using a [file system (type)]". 
 . has a file/dir mgmt interface
 . a single holistic file system is typically comprised of other file systems
    . ex.: proc (interface to kernel's data structures , info about processes , etc.)
    . ex.: tmpfs (for fast r/w operations ; always stored in RAM , never on the disk)
    
========================================================================================================
 . mkfs()
 
 . ingredients :
    . storage device
    . file system type

 . shape : a uniform fs tree
========================================================================================================
 . sda's           - partitions
 . ext's , NTFS    - file systems


 . mount() : inserts the [NEW FS TREE] inside the [EXISTING FS TREE IN A PARTITION] at a [MOUNT POINT]
    |
    $ mount -t [fs] [partition] [mount point]
    $ mount -t ext3 /dev/sda1 /home/users
    |
    $ ls /home/users/ one two
       . /home/users/    - root of new fs 
========================================================================================================
