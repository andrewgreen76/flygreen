EDID stands for Extended Display Identification Data. It is a standard data format that displays, monitors, and other display devices use to communicate their capabilities and characteristics to a connected computer. The information provided by EDID includes details such as the supported display modes, resolutions, color depth, aspect ratio, and manufacturer-specific information.

When you connect a display device, such as a monitor or projector, to a computer, the computer queries the display for its EDID information. This helps the operating system and graphics drivers to automatically configure the display settings, ensuring optimal compatibility between the computer and the connected display.

Key points about EDID:

1. **Automatic Configuration:** The EDID information allows the computer to automatically detect and configure the display settings, eliminating the need for manual adjustments.

2. **Resolution and Timing Data:** EDID provides details about the supported display resolutions, refresh rates, and timing parameters.

3. **Color and Audio Capabilities:** Information about color depth, audio support, and other advanced display features may also be included in the EDID data.

4. **Vendor and Model Information:** EDID typically includes details about the manufacturer, model name, and serial number of the display device.

5. **Communication Protocol:** EDID data is often communicated between the display device and the computer using the IÂ²C (I2C) communication protocol.

The EDID data is stored in a binary format and is typically transmitted over the display interface (e.g., HDMI, DisplayPort) between the display device and the computer's graphics card.

In troubleshooting display-related issues, examining the EDID information can provide insights into the capabilities of the connected display and help diagnose problems related to resolution, refresh rate, or other display settings.
