The development of ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) involved several key concepts from discrete mathematics, which provided the foundational principles for its design and operation. Some of these concepts include:

1. **Boolean Algebra**: Boolean algebra is fundamental to digital logic design, which is at the heart of ENIAC's circuitry. ENIAC used vacuum tubes to implement logical operations such as AND, OR, and NOT, based on Boolean algebra principles.

2. **Combinatorics**: Combinatorial methods were used to optimize the configuration of ENIAC's switches and plugboards, ensuring efficient setup for various computations and minimizing the need for reconfiguration.

3. **Graph Theory**: Graph theory concepts were indirectly involved in the design of ENIAC's control and data flow. Understanding the paths and connections between different components of the machine helped in designing efficient circuits and control systems.

4. **Number Theory**: Number theory, particularly the understanding of prime numbers and modular arithmetic, played a role in designing arithmetic units and in performing complex calculations like those needed for cryptography and scientific computations.

5. **Finite State Machines**: The concept of finite state machines (FSM) was crucial in designing the sequential logic and control mechanisms of ENIAC. FSMs helped in managing the states and transitions during the execution of instructions.

6. **Algorithms**: Although ENIAC did not run high-level algorithms as we know them today, the principles of algorithm design, such as breaking down problems into smaller steps and iterative processes, were fundamental in programming the machine to perform specific tasks.

7. **Error Detection and Correction**: Basic principles of error detection and correction, such as parity checks, were employed to ensure the reliability of computations and to detect errors in data transmission and processing.

These discrete mathematics concepts were instrumental in the logical design, configuration, and operation of ENIAC, allowing it to perform a wide range of calculations and tasks effectively.
