Demand paging is a memory management scheme in which pages of a process are not loaded into memory until they are explicitly requested, or demanded, by the program during execution. The alternative memory management schemes include:

1. **Prepaging:**
   - In contrast to demand paging, prepaging involves loading not only the demanded page but also additional pages into memory. This can help reduce page faults by bringing in anticipated pages before they are explicitly requested. However, it may lead to unnecessary page reads if the prefetched pages are not actually used.

2. **Anticipatory Paging:**
   - Anticipatory paging is a strategy that aims to predict future page accesses based on program behavior. It involves loading pages into memory in anticipation of future demands. This proactive approach seeks to minimize the impact of page faults by having the required pages already present in memory.

3. **Swap Prefetching:**
   - Swap prefetching is a technique that involves reading pages from swap space into memory before they are explicitly requested. This is similar to prepaging but specifically focuses on bringing in pages from the swap area.

4. **Look-Ahead Paging:**
   - Look-ahead paging is a strategy that involves analyzing the access patterns of a process and loading pages into memory based on the observed behavior. It tries to predict future memory accesses and proactively loads pages to minimize page faults.

5. **Clustered Page Replacement:**
   - Clustered page replacement algorithms aim to replace or swap out entire clusters of pages instead of individual pages. This approach leverages the spatial locality of page references, assuming that neighboring pages are likely to be accessed together.

6. **Fetch Policy:**
   - Some systems allow users or applications to specify a fetch policy, which dictates how many pages should be brought into memory when a page fault occurs. This gives users more control over memory management and can be tailored to specific application requirements.

7. **Windowed Page Replacement:**
   - Windowed page replacement is a technique that divides the virtual address space into windows and uses different page replacement algorithms for each window. This allows for adaptive page replacement policies based on the characteristics of specific regions of the address space.

It's important to note that demand paging is a widely used and effective memory management strategy, and many modern operating systems employ variations of it. The alternatives mentioned above may have trade-offs in terms of system overhead, complexity, and the ability to adapt to dynamic program behavior. The choice of a particular memory management strategy depends on the specific goals and characteristics of the computing environment.
