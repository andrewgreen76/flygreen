DHCP METHODS 
===================================================================================

Dynamic allocation : 
  1. an IP address range is reserved for a group of close client devices
  2. any one IP address in that range can be given to any one client device
  +. a different IP address can be given to the same client device every time 


Automatic allocation : 
  1. an IP address range is reserved for a group of close client devices
  2. the same IP address in that range is ASSIGNED again to the same client device (if at all possible)
      . this might not apply to every local client device 


Fixed allocation :
 . a manually specified list of MACaddr-to-IPaddr mappings
 . no IP address range reservation involved
 . If no mapping found for the newly connected device with a certain MAC address, the server will resort
     to either (a) other DHCP methods or (b) refusal to assign an IP address.
 . a good security measure from connecting untrusted client devices (that may or may not intend to steal
     an IP address) 


These are simply configured for the DHCP server.
