A process can be described by :
- its state (running, ready, etc.)
- the contents of its address space
- its register context
- I/O info (e.g., open, readable, writable files) 



Process states : 
- Process is moving from "ready" state to "running" state	   =    SCHEDULED PROCESS
- Process is moving from "running" state to "ready" state	   =    DESCHEDULED PROCESS
- Reading from or writing to storage by IO subsys is in progress   <> 	BLOCKED / WAITING PROCESS
  - In the meantime, another process can occupy the CPU. 
- The process has finished all of its tasks    	    	   	   = 	DONE
