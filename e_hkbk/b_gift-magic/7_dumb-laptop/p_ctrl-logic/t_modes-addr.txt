Yes, in some assemblers, including NASM and MASM, specifying the data width (e.g., dword ptr) is not always required, especially when the assembler can infer the size of the operand from the context. In these assemblers, "mov eax, [0x12345678]" is generally acceptable and equivalent to "mov eax, dword ptr [0x12345678]". However, it's good practice to be explicit about the size of data being accessed for clarity and to avoid potential errors.

"
In x86 assembly language, addressing modes include immediate (where data is directly specified), register-to-register (where data is moved between registers), register-indirect (where data is accessed indirectly through a register), and memory-indirect (where data is accessed indirectly through a memory address).
