What does it mean for a language to be normal-order?

 . "A language is **normal-order** if it evaluates expressions by reducing the outermost (leftmost) function
    application first, delaying evaluation of arguments until their values are actually needed."
 . "A language is **normal-order** if it evaluates a function call by executing the function body first and only
    evaluating its arguments if and when their values are needed."



What does it mean to reduce a function application?

 . evaluating the function body somehow before the arguments are even applied (only when those arguments are needed)
 |
 . "Reducing a function application in a normal-order language means always reducing the leftmost-outermost redex
    (reducible expression) first. In practical terms, this means that functions are applied to their arguments before
    the arguments themselves are evaluated. This strategy is also known as "fully expand and then reduce", or simply
    calling a function by name (not by value)."


"
In other words, a function can receive arguments WITHOUT NECESSARILY USING ALL OF ITS PARAMETERS during execution.
