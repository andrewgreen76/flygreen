Event loop : 
 . a loop in code that persistently waits for something 

Event handler :
 . a piece of code that "responds" to an event

Here's how event-based concurrency is made possible on a single-core CPU : 
 |
 . an EVENT QUEUE needs to implemented for storing events 
 . the event loop waits until the queue is not full
 -> the event loop cycles through the queue
 => events are handled concurrently 

=========================================================================================
=========================================================================================
Scheduling = order of execution. 
=========================================================================================
=========================================================================================

 . All that a concurrent sys/app does is waiting on and processing events. 
 . Determining the next event to handle = scheduling (in event-driven concurrency).
    . governed by the CPU scheduler and the kernel
