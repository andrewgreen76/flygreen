Cryptography:
 . the practice of using mathematical techniques to keep stored/transferred private data secure
 . hiding messages
 . using encryption
 . using authentication
 . for preservation of integrity of data
 . cryptology - the study of cryptography


Encryption:
 . taking a readable message (PLAINTEXT), applying an encrypting operation (CIPHER) based on an ENCRYPTION ALGORITHM
   and using a unique value (KEY), and producing unreadable CIPHERTEXT
 . Naturally, decryption is the reverse.


Cryptosystem:
 . consider KG as algorithms for key generation
 . consider E as algorithms for encryption
 . consider D as algorithms for decryption
 . cryptographic service = KG + E + D


Security through obscurity:
 . i.e., the key or the encryption algorithm must be kept secret
 . B secures A, but then you'd have to secure B.
 . This invalidates simple cases of security through obscurity.


Kerckhoff's principle:
 . The cryptosystem must remain secure even if everything about the system is known - except for the key.
 . a.k.a., Shannon's maxim
 . a.k.a., "the enemy knows the system"
