Yes, graphics APIs often have corresponding libraries that provide the necessary functions and utilities to interact with the API. These libraries are commonly referred to as software development kits (SDKs) or libraries, and they provide a higher-level interface for developers to work with the graphics API.

For example, in the case of OpenGL, there are several libraries available, such as:

1. OpenGL Utility Library (GLU): GLU provides a set of higher-level functions built on top of the core OpenGL API. It offers utilities for common operations like matrix manipulation, texture generation, and polygon tessellation.

2. OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library (GLEW): GLEW simplifies the management of OpenGL extensions by providing a cross-platform way to access and use extensions that may not be supported by the core OpenGL implementation on a particular system.

3. Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL): SDL is a multimedia library that includes support for OpenGL along with other functionalities like window management, input handling, and audio. It provides an abstraction layer that simplifies cross-platform development.

Similarly, other graphics APIs like DirectX (used primarily on Windows) also have associated libraries like Direct3D for 3D graphics, Direct2D for 2D graphics, and DirectCompute for GPU-based parallel computing.

These libraries enhance the developer experience by providing convenient abstractions, helper functions, and utilities that simplify common tasks and reduce the amount of boilerplate code required to work with the underlying graphics API.
