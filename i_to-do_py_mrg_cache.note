silly dict
can't run py script from bash script
statically typed:
- determined/accessible at compile-time
- not accessible during runtime. 
objects :
- structs :
  - organization,
  - (using ptrs to build and manip. data structures - not to be confused with structs)
    - data structures retain node organization
    - data structures retain their own organization
    - data structures help us use memory economically (keep us away from memory bottlenecking) 
- (unions) 
ptrs :
- problems w/o ptrs:
  - 
  - tying objects together to make structures
  - 
- purpose:
  - dyn.memgmt,
  - distant recall (remembering without moving),
  - aliasing ("I hate having to write the identifier for the same memory address")
