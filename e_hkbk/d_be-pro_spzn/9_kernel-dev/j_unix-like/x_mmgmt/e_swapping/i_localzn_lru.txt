. processes read data structures and fixed code in a loop

=================================================================================

A couple of sound algorithms for page replacement policies :
. least-frequently-used (LFU)
. least-recently-used (LRU) 

=================================================================================
"
In a system with hundreds of pages accessed randomly thousands of times, 
FIFO, random, and LRU perform about the same



In a system with pages accessed unevenly (where 80% of accesses were only 20% of the pages), 
LRU performs the best



In a “looping sequential” system where pages are accessed in order and cache size is one less than the number of pages (e.g. a cache of size 3 that accessed 0,1,2,3,0,1,2,3), 
random performs best
