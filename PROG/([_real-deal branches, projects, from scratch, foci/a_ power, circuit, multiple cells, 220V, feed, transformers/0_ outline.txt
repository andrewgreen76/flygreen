
power generator
transformer
 . as a voltage booster
 . AC voltage can be changed by routing a current from a coil with 
   one configuration to a coil with a different configuration.  
power transmitter
transformer
 . as a voltage attenuator

sub-station, 
power quality regulation, 
breakers to isolate faults 

feeders to tamp voltage down to ideal level 
power reception

DC vs. AC (60 Hz direction switch)

AC: 
 + safer 
 + efficient 
 + easy to change voltage
