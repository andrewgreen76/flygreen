A:	A diode allows the current to flow only in one direction.



Q:   	But doesn't current always flow in one direction? Under what circumstances
	would it change direction? 

A:   	"The common 120V 60Hz found on the wall outlets in civilized countries
	changes direction 60 times [e]very second. It’s not "sudden", but it does
	change. 

	Another good example might be a circuit that normally supplies 13.5V DC
	to your car’s headlights. ... [or] when the car suddenly gets hit by lightning
	[, but] that's a bit extreme."
