THE FORM OF BIOS - PURE BINARY ON EEPROM :  
========================================================================================

"
... the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) is typically a raw binary file. It contains low-level code that is executed directly by the CPU when a computer is powered on, initializing hardware components and starting the boot process. This code is usually stored in a non-volatile memory chip on the motherboard and is often referred to as firmware. BIOS files are not formatted in a specific file type like executable files for an operating system; instead, they consist of raw machine code that the processor can execute directly.

... BIOS firmware often comes in the form of a binary image file. These binary image files are used for various purposes, including:

1. **Firmware Updates**: Manufacturers provide BIOS updates as binary image files that users can flash to their motherboardâ€™s EEPROM to update the firmware. These files are often distributed with an extension like `.bin`, `.rom`, or `.fd`.

2. **Backup and Recovery**: Users or technicians may create backup copies of the BIOS firmware as binary image files to restore or recover the BIOS in case of corruption or failure.

3. **Configuration**: The binary image file contains the raw machine code and configuration data required by the BIOS to initialize hardware and manage the boot process.

The binary image file format for BIOS is specific to the manufacturer and motherboard model, and it typically includes both the code and data needed for the BIOS to function properly.
