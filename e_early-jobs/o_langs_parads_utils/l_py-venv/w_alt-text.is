Alt text coding in Python typically refers to the process of adding alternative text (alt text) to images in web development or other contexts. Alt text is a textual description of an image that is used to provide information about the image's content for individuals who cannot see the image, such as visually impaired users or when the image fails to load.

In Python, alt text coding typically involves working with HTML and web development frameworks to generate HTML tags with appropriate alt text for images. Here's an example of adding alt text to an HTML image tag using Python:

```python
image_url = "path/to/image.jpg"
alt_text = "A beautiful sunset"

# Generate HTML tag with alt text
html = f'<img src="{image_url}" alt="{alt_text}">'

# Use the generated HTML in your web application or output it to a file
print(html)
```

In this example, the `image_url` variable holds the path or URL to the image file, and the `alt_text` variable contains the descriptive text for the image. Using string interpolation, the HTML tag is generated with the `src` attribute pointing to the image URL and the `alt` attribute set to the alt text.

By including alt text in HTML image tags, you ensure that the content of the image is accessible to all users, regardless of their ability to see images. This practice is important for web accessibility and complying with accessibility guidelines.
