Is it true that UEFI is proprietary?

No, it is not accurate to say that UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) is inherently proprietary. UEFI itself is an open industry standard for firmware that replaces the traditional BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) in modern computer systems.

UEFI was developed by the Unified EFI Forum, which is a consortium of technology companies including major hardware manufacturers such as Intel, AMD, Microsoft, and others. The specifications and standards for UEFI are openly available to the public and can be accessed and implemented by anyone.

While UEFI itself is open, the implementation of UEFI firmware by individual hardware manufacturers can vary in terms of their specific features, customizations, and proprietary components. Some hardware manufacturers may include proprietary elements or drivers within their UEFI firmware implementations, but that does not mean UEFI as a standard is inherently proprietary.

In fact, UEFI is designed to provide more flexibility, functionality, and compatibility compared to the traditional BIOS. It allows for secure booting, better hardware initialization, support for larger storage devices, and improved software interaction during the boot process.

It's important to distinguish between the UEFI standard itself, which is open and freely available, and specific firmware implementations by hardware manufacturers, which may include proprietary elements. Many computer systems, including those that support Linux distributions, use UEFI firmware with varying degrees of openness and proprietary components depending on the specific implementation.
