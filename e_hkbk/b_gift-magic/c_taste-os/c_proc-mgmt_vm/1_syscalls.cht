Syscalls :
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Some from <unistd.h> - this library holds system calls and low-level I/O operations as well as the macros for them. 
- "These calls involve a transition from user mode to kernel mode to perform privileged operations provided by the operating system."

- open()
- read() 
- write()
- fsync()
  - Changes made to a dedicated file descriptor are stored on a storage device, ensuring persistence of changes. 
- close()
- exit() - exits in the middle of the program, returning the arg as a stat.cd to the OS

- getpid()

- fork()
  - returns a value > 0, i.e., the PID of the child process within the parent process
  - returns 0 within the newly generated child process ; getpid() returns the PID of this child process
  - return a value < 0 if the process failed to generate a child 

- wait() / wait(NULL)
  - if the child runs first , the child will finish before the parent
  - if the parent runs first , it will wait for the child to finish 
  - this means deterministic output
  - wait() returns the PID of the child the parent is waiting on 

- sleep(n) - idle for n seconds 

- exec()
  - 



- waitpid()
