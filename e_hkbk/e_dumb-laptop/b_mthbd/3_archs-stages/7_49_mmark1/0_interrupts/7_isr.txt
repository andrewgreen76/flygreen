INTERRUPT SERVICE ROUTINE (ISR) : 
========================================================================================

"
ISR had the capability of disabling the other devicesâ€™ interrupts while enabling the present device interrupts and it can re-enable the other device interrupts after completion of execution.

Interrupt_Service Routines are always ready to act because the maximum number of interrupts is of asynchronous type.

This interrupt_service mechanism can make the ISR work for multiple sources.

The ISR can handle both non-maskable and maskable interrupts. The program line can be used to enable or disable the handler.
The ISR can also be used for the diversion of unimportant instructions.
