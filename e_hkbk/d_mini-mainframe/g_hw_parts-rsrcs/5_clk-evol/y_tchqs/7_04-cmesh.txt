Clock mesh architecture was first introduced in Intel processors with the release of the Intel Pentium 4 "Prescott" microarchitecture in 2004. This architecture utilized a mesh network topology to distribute clock signals across the chip, which helped to reduce clock skew and improve clock distribution efficiency, particularly in large multicore processors.
