THE STACK'S INTERNAL POINTER. Allows us to : 
 . navigate the stack 
 . monitor values 
 . change values within it
 |
 . We could totally do those things with the knowledge of where SP is at. 
     However , SP can change , mostly due to dynamic memory allocation ,
     but BP will never change for as long as we are using the stack frame.
