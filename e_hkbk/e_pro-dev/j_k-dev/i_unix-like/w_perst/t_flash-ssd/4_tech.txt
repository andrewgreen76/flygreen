THE TECH OF FLASH-BASED STORAGE : 
============================================================================

 . flash chips are made of pure silicon
    => more durable/reliable than HDDs 

=================================================================================
DRAWBACKS OF FLASH-BASED STORAGE : 
=================================================================================

 - subsequent writes to THE SAME PAGE can't be close to one another 
    . due to the physical properties of transistors in NAND flash memory
    . the transistors will be "worn out" (charges will linger) 
    . break up consecutive writes with erase before write 
    - erases are not perfect ; tiny charges will still linger in cells and accumulate over time
    |  => may result in 0 when it should be 1 and vice versa
    |
    . LIFETIMES :
       . SLC : 100,000 program/erase (P/E) cycles (may turn out to be longer than expected) 
       . MLC : 10,000 program/erase (P/E) cycles 

 - before erasing/writing to THE SAME FLASH PAGE its entire block must be erased
    . physically it would be very impractical to design and develop a mechanism
      that can erase individual tiny pages
    . (this is especially true for multi-level cell (MLC) configurations)

 - disturbance :
    . neighboring bits can get flipped (read disturb , a.k.a. program disturb) 

 - erases are long (ms , not us) 

=================================================================================
RECAP : 
=================================================================================

Recap :
 (1) only the entire block can be erased
 (2) only an erased page can be individually programmed (written to)
 (3) to reprogram a page it must be erased (see [1])
 (.) to preserve the other pages the entire block must be buffered
