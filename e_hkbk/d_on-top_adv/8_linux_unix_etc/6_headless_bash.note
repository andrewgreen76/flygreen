Is there a Bash command for streaming a specific line from a file to add to another file?
ChatGPT

Yes, there are multiple Bash commands that can be used to stream a specific line from a file and append it to another file. Here are a few examples:

    Using sed:

    bash

sed -n '3p' source_file >> destination_file

This command uses sed with the -n option to suppress automatic printing. The 3p command tells sed to print the third line of the source_file. The >> operator is used to append the output to the destination_file.

Using awk:

bash

awk 'NR==3' source_file >> destination_file

This command uses awk with the pattern NR==3 to match the third line of the source_file. The default action in awk is to print the matching line. The output is then appended to the destination_file using the >> operator.

Using tail and head:

bash

    tail -n +3 source_file | head -n 1 >> destination_file

    This command uses tail with the -n +3 option to output all lines starting from the third line of the source_file. The output is then piped (|) to head with the -n 1 option to extract the first line. Finally, the result is appended to the destination_file using the >> operator.

These commands demonstrate different approaches to accomplish the task. Choose the one that best suits your needs based on the specific requirements of your scenario.
