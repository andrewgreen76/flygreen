DNS ZONE
===================================================================================

A concept for an implementation that would allow for an easier control over all levels of every domain name. 


Collectivelly, all ROOT SERVERS CATER TO THE GLOBAL ROOT ZONE
 . a root server = an authoritative name server with a DNS zone used in special cases 


Every TLD NAME SERVER has its own DNS zone covering the respective TLD, e.g. ".com"
 . likewise, there has to be one and only TLD name server dealing with ".net"
 . a single TLD name server - for ".org"
 . etc.
 . a TLD name server = an authoritative name server with a DNS zone used in special cases 


An authoritative name server : 
 . helps resolve a specific domain that would have its own DNS zone
 . the same auth.name server can cover a number of DNS zones - defined in """DNS zone files"""
 . a subdomain/IP address for every DNS zone (file), with every auth.name server machine supporting multiple
     tiny DNS zones (with their files) 


!!! DNS zones do NOT overlap. !!!
 |
 . That is, the TLD DNS zone and the authority governing it are completely separate from the authoritative DNS
 |   zones and the authority administering those.
 |
 . That is, anything the **TLD name server DNS zone authority** has to do or say about Google's domain name
 |   ("google") will have to be run by **the entity administering the authoritative name server and it DNS
 |   zones**. It's the latter entity gets the say on what to do about the domain.
 |
 . And vice versa, the auth.name server can't do anything about Google's TLD (".com"). 


Ex.: therealbeatles.com :
 . let's not have one DNS zone for the band 
 . 5 auth.name servers total 
    . therealbeatles.com
    . john.therealbeatles.com
    . paul.therealbeatles.com
    . george.therealbeatles.com
    . ringo.therealbeatles.com
 . 1 auth.name server for the band
 . one auth.name server, with a subdomain, for each of the 4 individuals => an actual total of 4 DNS zones
