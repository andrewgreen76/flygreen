Yes, there is a practical size limit to constructs like lists or tuples in Python. The limit is imposed by the available memory of the system on which the Python interpreter is running.

Lists and tuples are dynamic data structures, meaning they can grow or shrink in size as needed during runtime. However, the amount of memory available to your Python program will determine the maximum size these constructs can reach. If you attempt to create a list or tuple that is too large to fit into memory, you may encounter a "MemoryError" exception.

For example, trying to create an extremely large list on a system with limited memory could lead to an out-of-memory error:

```python
# This may cause a MemoryError if the system does not have enough memory available
large_list = [0] * 1000000000
```

It's important to consider memory constraints when working with large data structures. If you need to work with very large datasets, you might consider using more memory-efficient data structures or techniques, such as generators or streaming data processing.

Keep in mind that the exact size limit can vary based on factors like the system's architecture, available RAM, and the specific Python implementation you're using (e.g., CPython, PyPy).
