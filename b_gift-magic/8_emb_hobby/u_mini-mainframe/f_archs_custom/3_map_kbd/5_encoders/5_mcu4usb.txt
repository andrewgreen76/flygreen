A laptop keyboard typically has **(1) the keyboard encoder IC** and **(2) the microcontroller**; it does **not** typically have a separate **(3) USB controller**, as the keyboard is usually connected to the laptop's internal motherboard via a different interface (directly to the chipset).
"


"
A keyboard encoder IC is usually connected to a **microcontroller** to handle the input processing, while the **USB controller** manages the USB-A interface communication.
"


"
... a keyboard encoder IC typically requires additional components, such as a **USB controller** or **microcontroller**, to support the USB-A interface.

"
... there doesn't seem to be a dedicated **6x15 keyboard matrix encoder IC with USB-A support** without involving a microcontroller. Typically, USB support and more complex matrix scanning are handled by microcontrollers rather than discrete encoder ICs.
