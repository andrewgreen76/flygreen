In Bash, there is no specific command dedicated to jumpstarting a network connection. However, you can use a combination of commands to troubleshoot and manage network connections. Here are a few commonly used commands:

- `ping`: The `ping` command is used to send a network request to a specific IP address or domain name to check if it's reachable. It can help you diagnose network connectivity issues.

- `ifconfig` or `ip`: These commands allow you to view and configure network interfaces, IP addresses, and related network settings.

- `route` or `ip route`: These commands display or manipulate the IP routing table, which determines how network traffic is directed.

- `netstat`: The `netstat` command provides information about active network connections, listening ports, and network statistics.

- `iptables` or `ufw`: These commands are used to configure and manage firewall rules, which control network traffic.

- `nmcli`: This command-line tool is used to manage NetworkManager, a network management service commonly found in Linux distributions. It provides a wide range of functionalities for managing network connections.

The exact commands and options you use will depend on your specific network configuration and the issue you're trying to address. It's recommended to consult the relevant command's man pages (`man <command>`) or refer to the documentation for more details on their usage.
