========================================================================================
POSSIBLE SERVER FAILURES - CAUSE AND EFFECT : 
========================================================================================

 .    request lost 
 .    server is offline (made unavailable)  ->    lack of responsiveness to the client (requests are ignored) 
 .    crash   ->   loss of communication    ->    lack of responsiveness to the client (requests are ignored)
 .    reply lost
 

A client can retry. 
  (a) server responds => timer is cancelled
  (b) server does not respond before timer expires => client can resend the request 


========================================================================================
IDEMPOTENT OPERATIONS AND RECOVERY : 
========================================================================================

 . "the result of repeating the same operation is the same every time"
 . operations that make no impact on the data ... WELL , NOT EXACTLY
 . change in the result after the first execution ; no change after repeated executions of the same operation
 . when a server fails to respond to any idempotent operation , it is safe to retry it 
 . retrying stops when the client hears back from the server 


Examples : 
 . retrying LOOKUP
 . retrying READ (at file's origin)
 . retrying a logical operation
 . retrying file creation/deletion
 . retrying bitwise WRITE (overwrite of the same piece ; see below)
 |  
 . NFS crash recovery relies on idempotence
 |  . no need to worry about accidental unwarranted alterations ; they won't happen
 |
 . NFS operations (or queries) are idempotent 


Non-idempotent operations :
  . retrying an arithmetic operation 
  . retrying append-write or insert-write
