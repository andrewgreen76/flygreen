Direct mapping for small (random) writes :
 . quick , direct mapping for every page 
 . more populated pages => more mappings 
    

Block-level mapping for large (sequential) writes : 
 . slow mapping (direct-to-block , then use offset) for every page
 . fewer mappings in the table

HYBRID MAPPING : 
==========================================================================================

Small, random write :
 . any one-page write fed to the SSD , unrelated to other writes 

Log block :
 . write "buffer" for the SSD 
 . wear leveling for actual target blocks  
 . periodically relieved for future sequential writes
 . "the difference lies in how data is organized, managed, and programmed within these blocks"
 

 . dual record-keeping :
   | 
  (1) the LOG TABLE - for small , random writes (laid down sequentially) 
   |  . just a few LOG BLOCKS are reserved
   |  
  (2) the DATA TABLE - for large , sequential writes
 
 . should reduce log-block count 


Idea :
 . multiple pages <= multiples logical blocks mapped to the same block
 . one logical block <-> one physical page
