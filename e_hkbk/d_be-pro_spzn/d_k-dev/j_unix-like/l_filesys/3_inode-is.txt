Inode ("index node") :
-----------------------

 . all nodes are data structures
 . "a file system's personal persistent data structure" 
 . every inode is unique , dedicated to a file/dir , and has a purpose : 
 | . provides the standard way of accessing the file/dir
 |   . holds pointers to all blocks of the file   
 | . provides metadata about the file/dir (file type , file size , permissions , etc.) 
 | . is useful in caching for quick access to the file/dir
 . "All inodes are stored on disk, with a copy in memory to speed up access."


 . all inodes ... 
   . stored in the inode table (a.k.a. inode block) grown in the RAM
   . point to their respective files/dirs - nodes of a tree that is the filesystem , stored on the disk 
   => tied to one filesystem 
 |
 |
 . "different filesystems may have variations in the structure and content of inodes"
 . an inode does not include the actual name or the contents of the file/dir


Every inode has a unique number - inode number - that a file goes by in some places.
