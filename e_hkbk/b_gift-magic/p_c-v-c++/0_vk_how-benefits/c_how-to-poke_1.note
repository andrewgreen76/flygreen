ChatGPT

To plot a pixel on the blank screen using Vulkan API, you would typically need to follow these steps:

    Create a Vulkan instance and device.
    Create a swapchain to represent the window surface where the pixel will be displayed.
    Create a render pass that describes the type of rendering you want to perform, such as drawing a pixel.
    Create a graphics pipeline that will be used to render the pixel.
    Allocate a command buffer to store the commands that will be sent to the GPU.
    Record the commands in the command buffer to draw the pixel.
    Submit the command buffer to the GPU for execution.
    Present the image to the screen.

Here's some sample code that demonstrates how to draw a pixel using Vulkan API:
