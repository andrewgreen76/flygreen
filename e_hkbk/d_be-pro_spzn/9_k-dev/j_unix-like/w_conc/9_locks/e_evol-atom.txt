Evolution of atomicity enforcement mechanisms :

. old idea : 
  > disabling interrupts on all CPUs -and- 
  > regulating threads in the critical section with loads/stores of the barring flag value alone
  - handing control to other threads
    - toying with interrupts
    - losing interrupts 
    - lock-outs by the wrong threads 
    - arbitrarily long spinning (no signal to other threads , unattended barring flag)
    - inconsistent handling of hardware interrupts by multiple CPUs at the same time
