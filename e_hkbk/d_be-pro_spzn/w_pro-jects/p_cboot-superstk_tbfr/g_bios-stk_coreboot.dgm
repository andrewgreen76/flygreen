| If all goes well, ...

| payload : systemd (a.k.a. systemd init)
|
| If all goes well, ... 
| 
^ BTLD : load in the kernel
| ?? memgmt begins ??
^ CPU proc sched starts 
|
^ BTLD : drivers for GPU 
|
^ BTLD	  <>	dracut (drastic initramfs cut)	<>  initramfs (payload, temp filesys); 
| (payload : holds information about other partitions)
|
| BTLD : drivers for SSD
| BTLD : drivers for keyboard, other peris
^ Stage 1 and Stage 2 boot managers (bootstrap)		<<<	native OS provides the payload
|
^ sound, net, etc. 
^ POST init of GPU (for an API or dsrv) 
^ POST init of storage (loc of kernel and utils) 
^ POST init of keyboard (for prime interfacing)
^ POST init of RAM (modules, capacity, settings)	(no memory management yet)
^ POST init of CPU registers 	       			(no process scheduling yet)

  HW init 

^ CPU/cache
|
|
|
^ All that POST does is running diagnostics. No driver loading. 
|
^ UEFI : in NAND flash 
| BIOS : in CMOS
| alts : coreboot, libreboot 
|
|
x64 boot stack NOT cast in stone. Expect other designs.
