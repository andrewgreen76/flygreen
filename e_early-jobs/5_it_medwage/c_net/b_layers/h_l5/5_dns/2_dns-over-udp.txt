DNS typically uses UDP, but given the right circumstances a TCP connection would have to be established. 

===================================================================================
WHY DNS USES UDP :
===================================================================================

 . helps with the massive traffic of full DNS resolutions, which would be a challenge with TCP and its overhead
 |
 . a single UDP datagram is enough for a single request => the request datagram can be unconditionally sent 
 . a single UDP datagram is enough for a single response => the response datagram can be unconditionally sent
 . all parties involved in the full DNS resolution are trusted
 |
 - you might fail to send/receive a datagram or receive a bad datagram
 => integrity does not seem to be an issue 
 => it looks like IP address lookups are trivialized by design
 => {speed, trust} > {success of transmission} 


Compare this to multiplayer gaming : 
 . "... while many games use UDP for real-time communication due to its low latency, some also use TCP for
    reliability and control data."
 . "Control data is information exchanged between systems to manage, coordinate, or maintain a connection, rather
    than carrying the main content or payload."
 . "Multiplayer gaming communication often uses **UDP** instead of TCP to prioritize low latency over guaranteed
    delivery."
 => {uninterrupted gaming experience} > {speed}
