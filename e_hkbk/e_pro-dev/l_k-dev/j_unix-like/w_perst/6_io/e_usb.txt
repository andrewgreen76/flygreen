Yes, USB (Universal Serial Bus) connects to the CPU in a computer system. USB is a standardized interface that allows various peripherals and devices to connect to a computer for data transfer, power supply, and communication. USB is designed to be a universal and versatile connection standard, providing a convenient way to connect devices without requiring specialized ports for each type of device.

Here's how USB connects to the CPU:

1. **USB Ports:**
   - The computer's motherboard is equipped with USB ports, which are physical connectors where USB devices can be plugged in. These ports are often located on the front and back panels of desktop computers and on the sides of laptops.

2. **USB Controller:**
   - The USB controller is a component on the motherboard that manages the communication between the CPU and USB devices. It acts as an interface, translating the USB protocol into signals that the CPU can understand.

3. **USB Devices:**
   - USB devices, such as external hard drives, keyboards, mice, printers, and many others, connect to the USB ports on the computer. Each USB device has a specific function and communicates with the CPU through the USB controller.

4. **USB Hubs:**
   - USB hubs are devices that provide additional USB ports. They allow users to expand the number of available USB connections by connecting multiple devices to a single USB port on the computer. USB hubs are often used to accommodate more devices than the available ports on the computer.

5. **Data Transfer and Power Supply:**
   - USB supports both data transfer and power supply. Devices connected via USB can transfer data to and from the CPU and can also receive power from the USB port, eliminating the need for separate power cables in many cases.

6. **Plug and Play:**
   - USB devices are designed to be "plug and play," meaning that they can be connected or disconnected from the computer while it is running. The operating system and USB controller handle the detection and configuration of newly connected devices.

USB has gone through several generations, each offering improvements in data transfer rates. Common USB generations include USB 1.1, USB 2.0, USB 3.0, USB 3.1, and USB 3.2. Each generation is backward compatible with the previous ones, allowing devices to connect to newer or older USB ports on the computer.
