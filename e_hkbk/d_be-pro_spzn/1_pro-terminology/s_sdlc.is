The Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) is a systematic approach or process followed by software development teams to design, develop, test, and deploy software applications or systems. It provides a structured framework for managing the development process from start to finish, ensuring that software projects are completed efficiently, on time, and with high quality.

The typical phases in the Software Development Lifecycle include:

1. Requirements Gathering: In this phase, stakeholders, including clients, users, and development teams, gather and analyze the requirements for the software. This involves understanding the purpose of the software, the intended users, and the desired features and functionality.

2. Design: In the design phase, developers create detailed specifications and architectural plans for the software. This includes creating system design, database design, user interface design, and other technical documentation.

3. Implementation: This is the phase where developers write the actual code to implement the software based on the design specifications. The development process may follow various methodologies such as Agile, Waterfall, or Scrum.

4. Testing: After the implementation, the software undergoes rigorous testing to identify and fix any bugs or issues. Testing involves different types, such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing.

5. Deployment: Once the software has been thoroughly tested and is ready for production, it is deployed to the end-users or clients. This phase includes activities such as installation, configuration, and data migration.

6. Maintenance: After deployment, the software requires ongoing maintenance and support to address any issues, release updates, and add new features as needed. This phase may also involve bug fixes, security patches, and enhancements based on user feedback.

The SDLC can be tailored to fit the specific needs of the project and the development team. Additionally, some methodologies, like Agile and DevOps, emphasize continuous collaboration, iterative development, and rapid delivery, aiming to provide software that meets changing requirements and market demands more effectively.
