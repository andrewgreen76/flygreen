OPTIMIZING CLIENT-SERVER COMMUNICATION IN AN NFS : 
==================================================================================================


Massive I/O traffic on the link :
 |
 => slow DFS
 |
 + CACHING :
 |  . Instead of having the server playing close to the vest
 |    and the client sending tons of requests over the link ,
 |    a copy of the target can be moved over the link once
 |    and [CACHED] on the client's side.
 |
 + BUFFERING :
    . If we want to change the file and keep the updates ,
      we can write directly to the copy (located in the write buffer)
      and send it back to overwrite the original on the server's disk.
