STABLE AND UNSTABLE FS STATES : 
==================================================================================================================

Stable state of FS :
 . consistency between the bitmaps , inodes , and data blocks
 . before and after changes to FS (even if it means dropping the file changes)


When a crash or a power outage occurs in the middle of writing to FS , the FS is stuck in corrupt (inconsistent) state.
