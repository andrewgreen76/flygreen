The precision tool commonly used for [making] room for transistors and other features in semiconductor fabrication is known as an etching system, specifically reactive ion etching (RIE) or plasma etching systems.

Etching systems remove material selectively from the substrate surface according to the circuit pattern defined on it. This process allows for the creation of trenches, wells, and other structures necessary for embedding transistors, interconnects, and other components within the semiconductor material.

RIE and plasma etching systems offer precise control over the etching process, allowing for accurate definition of feature dimensions and shapes. These systems use chemical reactions or plasma to selectively etch specific materials while protecting others, enabling the creation of complex semiconductor structures with high precision.

In summary, while EBL systems are used for precision circuit drawing, etching systems, particularly RIE or plasma etching systems, are employed for carving out room for transistors and other components in semiconductor fabrication.
