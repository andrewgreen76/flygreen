The specific material used for a 3.5-inch screen for a Tetris game device can vary depending on the manufacturer and model of the device. However, in most cases, screens of this size are typically made using LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) technology.

LCD screens consist of multiple layers, including a liquid crystal layer sandwiched between two layers of glass or plastic. The liquid crystal layer changes its optical properties when an electric current is applied, allowing it to control the passage of light and create the visual display.

For a 3.5-inch screen used in a Tetris game device, the LCD technology would provide the necessary display capabilities for showing the game graphics, blocks, and other elements of the Tetris game. It's worth noting that advancements in display technology over time have led to various types of screens, such as color TFT (Thin-Film Transistor) LCDs, OLED (Organic Light-Emitting Diode) screens, and more, which can offer improved color reproduction, contrast, and power efficiency.

The exact type and technology of the screen used in a specific Tetris game device would depend on the manufacturer's design choices and the technology available at the time of production.
