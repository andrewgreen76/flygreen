SSD PERFORMANCE VS. HDD PERFORMANCE : 
===================================================================================================================================================

 + SSD's are random-access - meaning "any randomly picked address can be accessed immediately"
    . so are DRAM



Sequential r/w : 
 . both HDD's and SSD's - few hundred I/O ops/sec
 . but SSD's are somewhat faster 

Random r/w : 
 . SSD's are better by many miles

SSD rates : 
 . write rates > read rates
 . in a log-structured FTL logged random writes can be treated as a sequential write



"The performance difference between sequential and random I/Os is minor, yet reducing random I/Os is crucial when designing file systems."
