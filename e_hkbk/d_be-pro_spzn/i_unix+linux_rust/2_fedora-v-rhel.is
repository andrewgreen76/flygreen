Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) are two Linux distributions with different target audiences and purposes. Here are the main differences between Fedora and RHEL:

1. Target Audience: Fedora is a community-driven, free, and open-source distribution that focuses on innovation, cutting-edge technologies, and providing a platform for developers and enthusiasts. It serves as a testing ground for new features and technologies that may eventually be included in RHEL. In contrast, RHEL is a commercially supported enterprise-grade distribution designed for production environments and businesses that require stability, long-term support, and robust security features.

2. Release Cycle: Fedora follows a rapid release cycle, with a new version typically released every six months. It aims to showcase the latest software and technologies available in the open-source world. On the other hand, RHEL has a longer release cycle, with major versions typically released every few years. Each major release of RHEL receives long-term support and maintenance updates for an extended period, typically around 10 years.

3. Support and Stability: Fedora is a community-driven distribution and provides community support through forums, mailing lists, and community-driven documentation. It is best suited for users who enjoy staying on the cutting edge and are comfortable with frequent updates. RHEL, on the other hand, is a commercially supported distribution with dedicated support from Red Hat. It offers enterprise-level support, including security updates, bug fixes, and comprehensive documentation. RHEL is designed for organizations that require stability, predictable updates, and long-term support for their production environments.

4. Software Packages: Fedora offers a wide range of software packages and has a large software repository. It includes bleeding-edge software versions and provides a platform for developers to experiment and contribute. RHEL, being an enterprise distribution, focuses on stability and long-term support. It includes a more limited selection of software packages that have undergone rigorous testing and are known for their stability and reliability.

5. Licensing: Fedora emphasizes free and open-source software and includes only open-source components in its default repositories. RHEL also includes a significant amount of open-source software, but it also offers optional repositories with additional proprietary software and enterprise-focused tools.

While Fedora and RHEL share a common lineage (both are sponsored by Red Hat), their target audiences, release cycles, support models, and software selections differ. Fedora caters to enthusiasts and developers who value the latest features, while RHEL targets enterprise customers who prioritize stability, long-term support, and commercial support services.
