Yes, there are several open-source projects related to graphics drivers and APIs. Here are some notable examples:

2. Nouveau: Nouveau is an open-source driver for NVIDIA GPUs. It aims to provide 3D acceleration and support for the latest NVIDIA hardware on Linux systems.

3. AMDGPU: AMDGPU is an open-source graphics driver for AMD GPUs. It is part of the Linux kernel and provides support for various AMD Radeon graphics cards.

4. Intel Graphics Stack: Intel provides an open-source graphics stack for their integrated GPUs, including the Intel HD Graphics and Intel Iris Graphics. The stack includes the Intel Graphics Compiler, Mesa, and other components.

5. SwiftShader: SwiftShader is an open-source software renderer that provides high-performance graphics rendering for GPUs that don't support hardware acceleration. It is commonly used in virtualization and emulation scenarios.

6. ANGLE: ANGLE (Almost Native Graphics Layer Engine) is an open-source project that translates OpenGL ES API calls to DirectX API calls. It allows applications that use OpenGL ES to run on platforms that support only DirectX, such as Windows.

These projects and many others contribute to the development and improvement of graphics drivers, APIs, and related technologies in the open-source community.
