What Linux distro features the desktop environment with the lowest resolution?



Linux distributions typically provide a wide range of desktop environments, and the resolution of the desktop environment is not inherently tied to a specific distribution. The resolution of a desktop environment is primarily determined by the display hardware and the user's settings.

That being said, some lightweight desktop environments are known for their simplicity and low resource usage, which can be beneficial for older or lower-resolution display hardware. Examples of such lightweight desktop environments include LXDE (Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment) and Xfce. These desktop environments are designed to be resource-efficient and can work well on systems with lower resolutions.

However, it's important to note that the resolution of a desktop environment is not limited by the distribution itself but rather by the display hardware and the capabilities of the graphics drivers. The resolution can be adjusted and customized based on the user's preferences and the capabilities of the display hardware.
