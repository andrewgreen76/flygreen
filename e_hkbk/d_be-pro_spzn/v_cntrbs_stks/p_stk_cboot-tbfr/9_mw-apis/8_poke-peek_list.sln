Are there any open-source projects related to graphics drivers or APIs that give you the ability to peek and poke pixels?

Yes, there are open-source projects related to graphics drivers and APIs that provide the ability to peek and poke pixels. These projects often involve creating custom software that interacts directly with the graphics hardware or utilizes the APIs provided by the graphics driver to manipulate pixels. Here are a few examples:

    Mesa: Mesa is an open-source implementation of the OpenGL and Vulkan graphics APIs. It provides an infrastructure and libraries for developing graphics drivers, and it includes utilities like glxinfo and glxgears that allow you to query information about the graphics driver and perform basic rendering tasks.

    libdrm: The Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) is a subsystem in the Linux kernel that handles graphics drivers and provides an interface for user-space applications to interact with the graphics hardware. libdrm is a user-space library that provides a low-level API for accessing and manipulating the graphics hardware through the DRM interface. It allows you to perform operations like setting up framebuffers, manipulating buffers, and querying device information.

    Wayland: Wayland is a protocol and a set of libraries that provide a modern alternative to the X Window System for managing graphical display in Linux-based systems. Wayland allows direct interaction with the graphics hardware and provides a means to peek and poke pixels through its APIs.

These projects offer a starting point for developers interested in exploring and interacting with graphics drivers and APIs in an open-source context. By diving into the source code and documentation of these projects, developers can gain insights into how pixel manipulation and other graphics operations are implemented, and they can build their own applications or tools for peeking and poking pixels based on their specific requirements.
