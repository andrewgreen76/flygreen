One notable early example of interrupt-like mechanisms is found in the Analytical Engine, conceived by Charles Babbage in the 1830s. Although the Analytical Engine was never completed during Babbage's lifetime, its design included provisions for what Babbage referred to as "interrupting cards." These cards would alter the sequence of operations performed by the Engine, effectively interrupting its current task to handle special cases or conditions.

Another example is the Harvard Mark I, an electromechanical computer completed in 1944. While the Mark I did not feature interrupts in the modern sense, it did incorporate mechanisms for pausing and resuming calculations to perform manual interventions, such as patching program instructions or adjusting data inputs.

In the context of modern electronic digital computers, the Manchester Baby, or Small-Scale Experimental Machine, is often cited as one of the earliest systems to feature an interrupt-like mechanism. Developed in 1948, the Manchester Baby used a single interrupt button to stop the execution of its current program and manually input new instructions for immediate execution.

Ultimately, the concept of interrupts evolved over time alongside advancements in computing technology, with early examples found in various forms across different computing devices and systems. It's important to recognize that the specific implementation and terminology of interrupts have evolved considerably since their earliest manifestations.
