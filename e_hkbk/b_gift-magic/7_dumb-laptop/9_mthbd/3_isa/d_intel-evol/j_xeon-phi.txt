Yes, there are Intel microprocessors (MPUs) that feature multiple sets of general-purpose registers, particularly in architectures designed for parallel processing or specialized applications. These additional sets of registers help facilitate parallel execution of instructions and improve overall performance. 

One notable example is the Intel Xeon Phi family of processors. These processors, designed for high-performance computing (HPC) and parallel processing workloads, feature many cores, each with its own set of general-purpose registers. This allows for efficient parallel execution of instructions across multiple cores, enhancing the processor's overall throughput and performance.

Similarly, some specialized processors, such as those used in digital signal processing (DSP) applications, may also incorporate multiple sets of general-purpose registers to optimize performance for specific tasks.

However, it's important to note that this feature is not common in mainstream desktop or laptop processors, where each core typically shares a single set of general-purpose registers.
