Two purposes of a transistor :
 . (in analog circuits) amplifier - regulated by the base terminal 
 . (in digital circuits) switch - when the base changes from 0V to about 0.7V , the drain/emitter switches from 0 to 1 
    . technically an amplifier ; you just bypass the gradation between 0V and 0.7V 


Two common types :
 . BJT
 . MOSFET
