H-bridge is : 
 . "An H-bridge is an electronic circuit configuration that allows the direction of current to be
    controlled through a load, enabling bidirectional control of motors or other devices by switching
    the polarity of the applied voltage."


Role in battery charging :
 . "An H-bridge can be used in a charging circuit to control the direction of current flow, but it is not
    typically used by itself for charging a battery; additional circuitry, such as voltage regulation and
    protection, is required for safe and efficient battery charging."
