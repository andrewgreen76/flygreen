What does the id() function return in Python?

In Python, the id() function returns the unique identifier (an integer) of an object. This identifier is guaranteed to be unique and constant for the lifetime of the object.

The id() function provides a way to identify and distinguish different objects in memory. Two objects that are the same (i.e., they refer to the same memory location) will have the same id(), while different objects will have different id() values.

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of the id() function:

python

x = 42
y = x
z = 42

print(id(x))  # Print the id of x
print(id(y))  # Print the id of y
print(id(z))  # Print the id of z

print(x is y)  # Check if x and y refer to the same object
print(x is z)  # Check if x and z refer to the same object

In the above code, x and z are both assigned the value 42. Since 42 is an immutable object in Python, the interpreter optimizes memory usage and reuses the same memory location for both x and z. As a result, the id() of x and z will be the same.

The id() function helps you understand whether two variables refer to the same object or not, by comparing their id() values. The is keyword in Python can also be used to perform the same check, as shown in the code snippet above.

It's important to note that the id() value of an object is implementation-dependent and should not be relied upon for specific values or patterns. Its primary purpose is to provide a unique identifier for an object within the context of a single Python session.
