Allocating the entire SSD as reserved log blocks might not be practical or efficient for several reasons:

1. **Capacity Utilization:** Reserving the entire SSD for log blocks would mean sacrificing the majority of the SSD's capacity for data storage. This would significantly reduce the usable storage space for applications and user data.

2. **Cost:** SSDs are typically more expensive than traditional HDDs, and dedicating the entire SSD to log blocks would result in higher costs without delivering proportional benefits in terms of wear leveling or performance.

3. **Overhead:** Managing a vast number of log blocks could introduce additional overhead in terms of wear leveling, garbage collection, and other background processes. This could impact the overall efficiency of the SSD.

4. **Usability:** Users and applications expect SSDs to provide ample storage capacity for data. Reserving the entire SSD for log blocks would not align with typical user expectations or industry standards.

5. **Balancing Act:** SSD manufacturers aim to strike a balance between providing sufficient log blocks for wear leveling and optimization while still delivering a meaningful amount of storage capacity for users.

In practice, SSDs use a portion of the storage capacity as log blocks, strategically managed to optimize performance, lifespan, and cost-effectiveness. The specific allocation depends on the SSD's design, intended use, and the targeted balance between performance and capacity.
