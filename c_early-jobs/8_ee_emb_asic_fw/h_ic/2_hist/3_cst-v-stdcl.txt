[Before FPGAs] Chips were designed using **full-custom or standard-cell ASIC design with schematics and manual
  layout**, often simulated with early EDA tools long before reprogrammable FPGAs existed.

"
Full-custom design lets engineers hand-craft every transistor and wire for maximum performance, while standard-cell
  design assembles pre-designed logic blocks for faster, more automated chip development.
