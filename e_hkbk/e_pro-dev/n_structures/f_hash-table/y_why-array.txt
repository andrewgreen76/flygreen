The choice of using an array as the basis of a hash table is primarily motivated by the need for efficient random access and constant-time complexity for basic operations, such as insertion, deletion, and lookup. Arrays provide constant-time access to elements using their indices, making them well-suited for these operations.

Here are some reasons why arrays are commonly chosen for the underlying structure of a hash table:

1. **Random Access:** Arrays allow for direct and constant-time access to elements based on their indices. This is crucial for hash tables because the goal is to quickly locate the position where a key-value pair should be stored or retrieved.

2. **Cache Locality:** Arrays exhibit good cache locality, meaning that adjacent elements in memory are stored together. This property can improve performance since modern computer architectures fetch data from memory in chunks (caches), and accessing nearby elements can lead to better cache utilization.

3. **Simplicity and Efficiency:** The array-based implementation of hash tables is often simpler and more straightforward. It provides a clear and efficient way to organize and manage data.

4. **Dynamic Resizing:** Arrays facilitate dynamic resizing of the hash table. When the number of elements increases or decreases beyond a certain threshold, the array can be resized to maintain a suitable load factor. This process involves creating a new array, rehashing the elements, and updating pointersâ€”all of which can be done efficiently with arrays.

While arrays are commonly used, it's worth noting that linked lists are also employed in some hash table implementations, particularly for handling collisions. This approach is known as chaining. Each array index contains a linked list, and when a collision occurs (i.e., two keys hash to the same index), the new key-value pair is simply added to the linked list at that index.

The choice between arrays and linked lists depends on the specific requirements of the application and the trade-offs between factors such as memory usage, performance, and ease of implementation. Arrays are favored in scenarios where constant-time access and good cache locality are crucial, while linked lists may be preferred when handling collisions or in scenarios with dynamic resizing requirements.
