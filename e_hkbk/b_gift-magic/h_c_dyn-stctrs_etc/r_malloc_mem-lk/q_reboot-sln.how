	Potential for data loss: If the memory leak affects critical data or resources, rebooting may result in loss of unsaved data or corruption of important files.

To effectively address memory leaks in a C program, it's best to identify and fix the source of the memory leak directly within the code. Ensure that all dynamically allocated memory is properly released using functions like free() when it is no longer needed. This will prevent memory leaks and provide a more reliable and long-term solution.
