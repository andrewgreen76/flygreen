WHY EJECT/UNMOUNT A THUMB DRIVE
===================================================================================

 . The system has not actually finished r/w between the {data buffer (cache) of the computer} and {the thumb drive}.
 => Data on {the thumb drive} or {the data buffer in RAM/cache} will be left corrupted.
 => Removing the thumb drive incorrectly will result in system errors, especially if you remove the thumb drive too
      soon.
 . The thing is that the data buffer has a direct interface with the thumb drive, so anything that has to be read
     from or written to the drive will have to go through the data buffer first.
 . Signaling the system to unmount a disk (typically a thumb drive) will get it to cease any I/O activity with the
     drive.
