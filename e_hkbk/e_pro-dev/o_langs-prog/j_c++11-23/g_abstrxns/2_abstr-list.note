Other than templates, are there any other advanced measures of abstraction incorporated into C++11 and subsequent iterations?

Yes, C++11 and subsequent iterations of the language introduced several advanced measures of abstraction beyond templates. Here are some notable features introduced in C++11 and later versions that enhance abstraction capabilities:

    Lambda expressions: Lambda expressions allow the creation of anonymous functions, providing a concise way to define inline functions. They enable functional programming-style constructs, allowing for greater abstraction and expressive code.

    Type inference (auto and decltype): The 'auto' keyword introduced in C++11 allows for automatic type inference, where the compiler deduces the type of a variable based on its initializer. The 'decltype' keyword allows deducing the type of an expression at compile-time, facilitating the creation of generic code and enhancing abstraction.

    Range-based for loops: The range-based for loop in C++11 simplifies iterating over elements in a container or a range of values. It abstracts away the details of iterators and provides a more expressive and readable loop construct.

    Smart pointers: C++11 introduced smart pointers, such as std::unique_ptr, std::shared_ptr, and std::weak_ptr, which provide automated memory management and help prevent memory leaks and dangling pointers. Smart pointers add a higher level of abstraction and make resource management safer and more convenient.

    Variadic templates: Variadic templates allow the creation of functions and classes that can take a variable number of template arguments. This feature enables the creation of generic code that operates on multiple arguments of different types, providing enhanced abstraction and flexibility.

    constexpr functions and variables: The 'constexpr' keyword introduced in C++11 allows the evaluation of expressions at compile-time, promoting compile-time computation and enabling the creation of more efficient and flexible code.

    User-defined literals: User-defined literals enable the creation of custom suffixes that can be appended to literals to create objects of user-defined types. This feature adds a higher level of abstraction and allows for more expressive code.

These are just a few examples of advanced abstraction features introduced in C++11 and subsequent iterations. These features enhance code expressiveness, promote generic programming, and enable more efficient and flexible development in C++.
