How does


Long answer : 
 . We write the interrupt vector in our program to invoke a specific kind of service
   at runtime. 
    |
   (1) understand

 . the interrupt vector is used to compute a memory location 
 

fixed location in memory that holds the ISR address
  that can change from time to time.
  |
  => Hence the double (indirect) dereferencing - the interrupt vector is fixed , ISR address
     can be dynamically assigned or relocated.
