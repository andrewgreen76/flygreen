INDETERMINACY IN AN SR-LATCH : 
===================================================================================

"
When an SR-latch circuit first goes live with both Set (S) and Reset (R) inputs at 0, the outputs Q and Q' may start in an indeterminate state (not necessarily "no charge") due to initial conditions like noise, parasitic capacitance, or manufacturing variations, but they quickly stabilize to one of the valid states (Q=0, Q'=1 or Q=1, Q'=0) based on the feedback loop of the cross-coupled NOR or NAND gates, unless explicitly set by external initialization.

A two-switch (S-R) design that sets and clears the output.
- We achieve RETENTION. 
- We want to do better with a one-switch design than rely on the silly TWO-SWITCH design. 



The set-reset (SR) latch consists of two smaller NOR gates ; they inform each other with their own output that will serve as an input to the other gate. In other words, the output of one gate will influence the input-output of the other gate.

The other inputs are induced in other ways (usually with a key press) :
- S (set)=1 will clear the lead to the exploit output Q' - an input to the other gate, - lighting up the focal output Q ;
- R (reset) will turn the tables, shutting off the signal to Q - an input to the other gate, - thus setting Q'. The exploit output Q' is now also a dump output. 



This way we achieve two things :
- RETENTION of the state, something we have not seen before until now.
  - This plays a crucial role in storing data in CPU cache registers, system memory, disk space, and flash memory. 
- Having one input do one thing only - producing an effect - and the other input do one thing only - reversing that effect.



Consists of 8+ transistors. 



SUMMARY :
|
- SR-latch : captures and loses electrical signal on command with two keys (the set key and the reset key)
  - solves : latching a data bit is possible 
  - problem : you are doing this with two keys instead of one
