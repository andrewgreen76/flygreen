In most modern computer systems, including desktops, laptops, and servers, the clock is not part of the CPU itself but is instead generated by a separate component on the motherboard called the system clock generator or clock oscillator. This component generates electrical pulses at a specific frequency, known as the clock speed or clock rate, which synchronizes the operations of various components within the computer system, including the CPU, memory, and peripherals.

The CPU receives timing signals from the system clock and uses them to coordinate its internal operations, such as fetching instructions, executing instructions, and accessing data from memory. The CPU's performance is often measured in terms of its clock speed, which indicates how many clock cycles it can execute per second.

While the CPU relies on the system clock for timing, the actual generation and distribution of clock signals are managed by dedicated circuitry on the motherboard, separate from the CPU itself.
