Spinning (sleeping through) :
|
. relying solely on the barring flag , not using a condition variable (linking with the mutex) 
=> no way to tap a lock , release the mutex , communicate with other threads 
=> unable to tell other threads on the spot to resolve the barring flag sooner (while the calling thread is spinning)
=> CPU time is not shared with resolution threads , but wasted on the calling thread sleeping 
=> hope and pray that something else will change the condition (ideally , fairly quickly)
