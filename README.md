# This is an experimental edutainment/tutorial repository - a work in progress. 

__________________________________________________________________________
The PURPOSE of this repo:
__________________________________________________________________________

To help individuals, with or without a technical background, to: 
- improve their productivity in general (combatting ADD, figuring out
  alternatives to unhealthy solutions, etc.) 
- (especially for beginners)
  - hone their programming skills,
  - internalize key programming and engineering concepts,
  - learn about different systems,
  - understand and build a perspective on modern computing through studying
    its history.

> to run
  - to use for practical or artistic reasons
> to share

  - to hack ethically and creatively
  
JAtQ - Just Answer the Question:
- any question brought up to anyone involved in education must be answered
  without an inkling of annoyance or personality.

It is pretty upsetting that TurboC(++) is not cross-platform. That means
it can't be used at all for educational purposes. I understand that we have
something like Arduino for doing cool things like generating sound tones,
but there was a time when you could write just a few lines of code using
the dos.h library and get to not only playing sounds but also plotting pixels
on a PC. This user is not happy. To make matters worse, my impulsive
conversion of the Dell Inspiron, which had Windows as its native OS, to
Linux Ubuntu may have complicated things on the kernel level.

Perhaps I should do something about it. I'm not going to sacrifice my time
studying C, Rust, the Pop!_OS kernel, coreboot, and systemd for writing
an entire codebase for a safe, highly abstracted mirror of C, a fake,
that could tap into any hardware.

1) VM:
- 

2) DOSBox:
- But maybe there's something I could do inside DOSBox if at all.

- (TBA)
v too bold ; let's do something simple ^ 
- maintaining [the Linux kernel] >>>or<<< systemd

CHOSEN PERSONAL PROJECT:

- Just A GAME FOR DOSBOX is fine.
- own package -or- release / command.

> -
- a virtual machine,
- an emulator,
- or a video game that poses as an operating system (a la Last Call BBS).
  - Can I use the Unity Engine for that?
  - research dedicated toolchains. 
- challenge: faithful resolution
- plan of attack:
  - fide: 320x200
  - now: 1920x1200, 6 times both ways.
  - consider fair, authentic scaling. 
- learn BIOS-kernel-API/DSP-distro ladder for that 
- An API / display server protocol for a 13h-like mode portable to any headless system.
