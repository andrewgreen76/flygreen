Yes, Python provides the ability to write inline C code within Python scripts using various mechanisms. Here are a few options:

1. **Cython**: Cython is a superset of the Python language that allows you to write C extensions for Python. It provides a hybrid approach where you can mix Python and C code in the same file. Cython code is typically written in `.pyx` files, which are then compiled to C and integrated with Python. Cython offers static typing and other features for better performance.

2. **CFFI**: The C Foreign Function Interface (CFFI) is a Python library that allows calling C code from Python. It provides a way to write C code in separate files and create Python bindings for those functions. With CFFI, you can define C functions, structures, and other types in C files, compile them into a shared library, and then load and call those functions from Python.

3. **ctypes**: The `ctypes` module in Python provides a way to call functions in shared libraries (DLLs) written in C. It allows you to write Python code that directly interacts with C functions defined in external libraries. While not strictly inline C code, `ctypes` enables you to utilize existing C code within Python scripts.

These tools and libraries provide different approaches for integrating C code with Python and have their own features and use cases. They offer ways to write performance-critical parts in C while leveraging the high-level features and simplicity of Python.

It's worth noting that writing inline C code within Python scripts directly, without using external tools or libraries, is not natively supported in Python. The mechanisms mentioned above provide the means to combine Python and C code effectively while benefiting from the interoperability and performance characteristics of both languages.
