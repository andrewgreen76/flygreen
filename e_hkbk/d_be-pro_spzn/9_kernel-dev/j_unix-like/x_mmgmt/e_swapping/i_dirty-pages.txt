Dirty page :
. a page that has been updated
. reminder : every page has a "dirty bit" in its corresponding PTE

Original idea : 
? In the interest of persistence , the file that has just been modified would be evicted through move to the disk for preservation. 
  => clean pages are kept in RAM , dirty pages are moved to the disk 
  . But moving every page that gets updated can be costly. How can we do better ?

Alternative idea :
. Dirty pages are left in the RAM , clean pages are evicted to nothing (since it hasn't been recently accessed).
. But doesn't this sacrifice persistence if we don't move updated pages to the disk ?
. "the clock algorithm may be altered to look for pages that are both unused and clean to evict first;
   if those arenâ€™t found, then look for unused dirty pages, and so on."

=> Eviction can be done in either of two ways :
   . simple removal from the RAM
   . a move/swap into the disk
