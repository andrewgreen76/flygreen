SMPS stands for Switched-Mode Power Supply, while PSU stands for Power Supply Unit. 

These terms are often used interchangeably, but they refer to the same thing: a device that converts electrical power from an external power source (such as a wall outlet) into usable power for computer components. 

The SMPS or PSU is responsible for providing stable and regulated voltage levels to components like the motherboard, CPU, graphics card, storage drives, and peripherals within a computer system. It typically consists of various components such as transformers, rectifiers, filters, and voltage regulators to efficiently convert and distribute power to different parts of the computer. 

In summary, an SMPS or PSU is a crucial component in a computer system, responsible for providing reliable and stable power to ensure proper operation of all hardware components.
