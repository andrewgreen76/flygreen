CRASH RECOVERY IN AFS : 
========================================================================================

Client recovery :
|
Client must send a TestAuth after every reboot (just to check on the file's state).
  (a) still valid => client can still use it
  (b) not valid => get the latest copy from the server


Server recovery :
 |
(1) server loses the master backup 
(2) server loses all callbacks => has no sense of which client-cached entry is the latest
 ||
 vv
(a) server should alert clients of its own crash
(b) clients should check on the server periodically with a [HEARTBEAT message]
 |
 -> do cached-entry integrity/validity check 


AFS has a somewhat advanced yet scalable and recovery-capable caching model (compared to NFS).
