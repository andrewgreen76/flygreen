Community Memory is considered to be one of the earliest examples of a computerized public information sharing system that can be considered a precursor to the concept of online communities. It was developed and launched in 1973 in Berkeley, California, USA.

Community Memory was created by Lee Felsenstein, Efrem Lipkin, and others. It consisted of a computer system connected to several terminals placed in public locations, such as a store and a caf√©. The system allowed users to post messages and share information with others in the community.

The terminals provided an interface where users could input messages, which were then stored on the computer system. Other users could read and respond to these messages. The system enabled people to exchange ideas, share local news, advertise services, and engage in discussions.

Community Memory is notable for its focus on community participation and public access. It aimed to create a shared space where individuals could interact and contribute to the collective knowledge of the community.

While Community Memory predates the term "Bulletin Board System" (BBS), it shares similarities with BBSs and can be considered an early manifestation of online community platforms. It provided a glimpse into the possibilities of computer-mediated communication and foreshadowed the social aspects of the digital age we live in today.
