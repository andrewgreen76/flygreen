Password salt:
 . randomized data as additional input to the hashing function
 . produces a hash digest unique to the password+salt combo

   	    { password | salt } ---[hashing fxn]--> { salt | hash value }

 => This would multiply the size of the rainbow table.
 => A tremendous size of the salt would keep the hackers at bay for a long time.
 . Even UNIX had salts! 12-bit ones. So this is not a new idea.

 . "The largest *allowed* salt size in modern password-hashing standards like Argon2 can be extremely large (up
    to 2³²-1 bytes by specification), though best practices typically recommend something around **16–32 bytes**
    (≥128–256 bits) for strong uniqueness and security."
