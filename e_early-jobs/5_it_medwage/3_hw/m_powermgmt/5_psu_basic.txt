 . converts AC to DC
 . reduces the voltage fed to the hardware 
 . "... MAJOR HARDWARE COMPONENTS of a computerâ€™s architecture, including the motherboard, chipsets,
    CPUs, RAM, storage, peripherals, expansion slots and cards, etc. ... INFLUENCE THE SIZE AND TYPE
    OF POWER SUPPLY A COMPUTER NEEDS."

ENSURING THE ELECTRICAL SAFETY OF THE TARGET MACHINE 
===================================================================================

Most of the western hemisphere "use the 110-127 VAC standard for common wall sockets".
Most of the eastern hemisphere "use the 220-240 VAC standard for common wall sockets".

If your target machine accepts VAC that is different to the local input voltage used in the common wall sockets :
 . replace the PSU for the appropriate VAC fixed in the replacement 
 . choose a replacement that features a dual-voltage switch
 . get an external power converter
