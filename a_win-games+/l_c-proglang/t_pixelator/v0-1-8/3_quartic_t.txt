Quartic time :
 (n) I am running a number of tests 
 (n) and every test is a display of a number of related frames
 (n) and painting every frame means printing a certain number of lines
 (n) and printing every line means printing a certain number of pixels or characters (like pseudo-pixels , or "superpixels") 

Not good. I get tearing , fragmented animations.
