THOUGHTS ON HOW AND WHEN TO CREATE MY OWN COMPILER 
===================================================================================

[??]		= your C compiler	~(cmp , comp , compl , cmpl)


Q : What is my attitude towards writing my first C compiler ?
Q : Do I want to write my second C compiler ? 


My first C compiler :
 . don't want to write another compiler - educating myself to educate others
 => will be following D. McCarthy's lead 
 . educational - clarity over brevity
    . very standard , very vanilla
    . in certain "compliance" with most other languages , especially C and the `make` utility
    . ALL STUDENTS SHOULD LEARN THE SAME CODE-READING AND CODE-WRITING HABITS
      (here imagination can get in our way) 
    . developed to be small
    . should stay small 
 . but still my own - ideally with "the brand name" and preferred identifiers (if possible) 


My second C compiler : 
 . don't really want to write another one
