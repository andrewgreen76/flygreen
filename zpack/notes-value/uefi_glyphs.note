How is font constructed for UEFI?

The font used in UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) is typically constructed using the TrueType font format. TrueType is a scalable font format that was developed by Apple and Microsoft in the late 1980s.

To construct a TrueType font for UEFI, a designer typically starts by creating a vector-based design of each glyph (or character) in the font. This design is then converted into a set of mathematical instructions that define the curves and shapes of the glyph. These instructions are stored in the TrueType font file, along with additional data such as glyph metrics and hints for improving rendering quality at small sizes.

UEFI firmware typically includes a built-in font renderer that can load TrueType fonts and render them on the screen. The renderer uses the mathematical instructions in the font file to generate high-quality, scalable images of the font glyphs.

The UEFI specification also defines a set of glyph images called the UEFI glyph database, which includes common symbols and characters used in UEFI interfaces. These glyph images are stored in a proprietary format and can be accessed by UEFI firmware without the need for a TrueType font file.

Overall, the use of TrueType fonts in UEFI provides a flexible and high-quality method for displaying text in firmware interfaces.
