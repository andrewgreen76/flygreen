What/how can you contribute (on GitHub) ?
|
Pick a project that is not only of utmost interest, but is also the easiest to contribute to.
 - FIRST AND FOREMOST : CHECK TO MAKE SURE THE ISSUE YOU'VE ENCOUNTERED HAS NOT BEEN REPORTED. 
 - NON-CODE contributions :
   - reporting bugs , typos 
   - skillfully written documentation
   - design/feature ideas 
 - TECHNICAL :
   - Pick an easy project to contribute to. 
   - Search for projects by languages you know. 
   - Degrees of complexity (roughly/tentatively easiest to hardest) :
     - Python code (libraries , modules , packages) 
     - web development
     - package managers
     - game/mechanic engines
     - anything pertaining to FPGA, ASIC, HDL (VHDL, VLSI, Verilog, SystemVerilog)
     - compilers, interpreters
     - APIs 
     - drivers
     > MCU code, e.g. Arduino Uno R4 (Minima, Wi-Fi)
     > MPU code, e.g. Raspberry PI 4 (A, B) , 400
       - hardware is NOT open 
     - firmware : coreboot , Arduino, Raspberry PI  
     - a kernel (and its source tree)  
 - Ideas : Keep tabs (literally, like web-browser tabs) on the projects of interest. 


Where do you contribute ? 
- It's different with every project.
  - Go to the project's GitHub page (if it has one) and see the README content.
  - If it's not on GitHub and it is a GNU-related project (Bash, Emacs, etc.), check out the GNU Savannah website. 


Where do you discuss potential contributions ?
  - GitHub Issues 
  - See if there are any mailing lists you can to subscribe to.
