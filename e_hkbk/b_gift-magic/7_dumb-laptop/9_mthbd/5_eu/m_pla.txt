PLA stands for Programmable Logic Array. In control logic, a PLA is a digital circuit that can be programmed to implement specific logic functions or control sequences. It consists of an array of programmable AND and OR gates, allowing for flexible configuration of logic operations to control the behavior of a system or device. PLAs are commonly used in microprocessor control units, where they help in executing instruction sequences and managing various system operations.
