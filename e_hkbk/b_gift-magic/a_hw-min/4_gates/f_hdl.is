HDL is :
- a functional language and a declarative language
  = it is purely about conditions and behavior, not data structures and dynamic manipulation
    -= (no procedures going on)
    -= everything is static
    -= inputs are unknown, not given within the implementation 
  = no code and data compilation or interpretation
