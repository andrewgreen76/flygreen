DEVICES INVOLVED IN NETWORKS 
===================================================================================

Servers :
 . computing devices with just the disk storage at the crux - FOR STORING USER AND INTERACTIVE DATA 
 . They connect to the Internet (satellites , towers , cables)and use it to deploy content to the client
   devices.


Clients :
 . devices that request and receive data
 . they do NOT connect to the massive global thing that is the Internet
 |
 . they DO connect to a LAN offered by the ISP
 -> the LAN pushes the client's requests (as digital PACKETS) via the Internet to the server's network
 -> the requests eventually make it to the server
 -> the server fetches those requests and provides the demanded content (also as packets) - essentially , data
 -> the data makes it through the server's LAN , hen via the INternet , to the client's LAN
 -> the client receives the content
