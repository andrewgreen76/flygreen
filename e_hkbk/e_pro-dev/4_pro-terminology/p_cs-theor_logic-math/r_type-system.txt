WHAT IS A TYPE SYSTEM (vs. grammar) 
===================================================================================

Grammar :
 . valid ways of writing statements , expressions , and other things
     idiomatic to the target programming language 
 . rules that "define[] the syntactical structure and formation of valid
     statements and expressions within that language"
 . unlike a type system , a grammar is concerned with syntax 


Type system :
 . (design / implementation for) how types work with different values and
     how they work within expressions in a programming language
 . unlike a t a gramgrammar is concerned with syntax 


"
A type system is a set of rules that assigns a type to each variable and expression in a programming language, determining how data can be manipulated and ensuring type safety by preventing type errors during compilation or runtime.

No, a type system is not a grammar; rather, it is a set of rules governing the types of values and expressions in a programming language, while a grammar defines the syntactical structure and formation of valid statements and expressions within that language.
