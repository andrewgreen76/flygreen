Memory speed refers to the rate at which data can be transferred to and from the computer's memory modules. It represents the speed at which the memory can read from or write to its storage cells. Memory speed is typically measured in megatransfers per second (MT/s) or gigatransfers per second (GT/s).

The term "MT/s" stands for megatransfers per second. It is used to indicate the number of million data transfers that can occur within one second. Each data transfer typically involves transferring a single piece of data (e.g., 8 bits) between the memory module and the memory controller or processor.

Memory speed, expressed in MT/s, is an important performance metric as it affects the overall data transfer rate and the system's ability to process information quickly. Higher memory speeds result in faster data access and retrieval, which can lead to improved system performance, especially in memory-intensive tasks such as gaming, video editing, or data analysis.

It's worth noting that memory speed is only one aspect of memory performance. Other factors such as memory latency, memory type (e.g., DDR4, DDR5), and the overall system configuration also play a role in determining memory performance. Therefore, it's essential to consider multiple factors when assessing memory performance and selecting memory modules for a specific system.
