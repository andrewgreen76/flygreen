The amount of signal loss in Ethernet cables over a specific distance depends on various factors, including the cable quality, the category of the cable, electromagnetic interference, and environmental conditions. Ethernet cables are typically designed to maintain signal integrity over specific distances, and these distances are defined for each category of cable.

The most common categories of Ethernet cables are Cat5e, Cat6, Cat6a, and Cat7, each with its own specifications for data transmission. Here's a general idea of the maximum recommended distances for different categories of Ethernet cables:

1. **Cat5e:** Cat5e cables are commonly used for Gigabit Ethernet. The maximum recommended length is 100 meters (about 328 feet).

2. **Cat6:** Cat6 cables are designed for higher data rates and reduced crosstalk. The maximum recommended length is also 100 meters.

3. **Cat6a:** Cat6a cables are an enhanced version of Cat6, capable of supporting higher data rates and often used for 10 Gigabit Ethernet. The maximum recommended length is 100 meters.

4. **Cat7:** Cat7 cables are designed to support higher frequencies and offer better shielding. The maximum recommended length is typically 100 meters.

As the distance increases beyond these recommended lengths, signal quality may degrade, leading to potential issues such as increased errors or a loss of connectivity. If longer distances are required, signal repeaters, switches, or fiber-optic solutions may be employed to maintain signal integrity.

Additionally, the presence of electromagnetic interference (EMI) from other electronic devices, power cables, or environmental factors can contribute to signal loss. Using higher-quality cables, ensuring proper installation practices, and minimizing sources of interference can help mitigate signal loss in Ethernet cables over extended distances.
