Once the latch is built and powered, S=0, R=0, Q=0, and Q'=0. Am I wrong?

In an SR latch, when both S (Set) and R (Reset) inputs are set to 0, the behavior of the latch depends on its previous state.

If the latch was previously in a stable state, meaning either Q (output) was 0 and Q' (complement of output) was 1, or Q was 1 and Q' was 0, then the latch will maintain that state with S=0 and R=0.

However, if the latch was in an indeterminate state or in a metastable state (such as both Q and Q' being 0 or both being 1) prior to setting S=0 and R=0, the behavior of the latch is undefined, and it may settle into any of the possible states.

To ensure predictable behavior and avoid metastability, it is best to initialize the latch in a known state before applying inputs. This can be done by setting either S=1 or R=1 to explicitly set the desired state of the latch.
