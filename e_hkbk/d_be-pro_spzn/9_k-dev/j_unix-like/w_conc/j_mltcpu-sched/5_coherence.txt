Cache coherence :
 . When a process migrates from one CPU to another , it loses the connection to its old cache with all the data therein. 
 . Cache coherence : resolution between the old and the new caches to serve the process.
    - At this point the new cache would have to access the same frequently needed data that used to be instantly available to the process.
