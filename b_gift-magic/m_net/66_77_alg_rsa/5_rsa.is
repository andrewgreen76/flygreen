When did RSA hosts and keys come in for the first time?

RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is a widely used public-key encryption algorithm that was introduced in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman. The RSA algorithm is based on the mathematical properties of prime numbers and is commonly used for secure communication, digital signatures, and encryption.

RSA keys, specifically public and private keys, are integral to the RSA algorithm. Public keys are used for encryption, while the corresponding private keys are kept secret and used for decryption. The concept of public-key cryptography, including RSA, revolutionized the field of secure communication by allowing two parties to communicate securely without needing to share a secret key.

To directly address your question, the concept of RSA hosts and keys came into existence when the RSA algorithm was introduced in 1977. Since then, RSA has become one of the most widely used encryption algorithms in various applications, including secure communication protocols, digital signatures, and encryption mechanisms for protecting sensitive data.
