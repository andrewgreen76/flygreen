APT - LINUX'S PACKAGE MANAGER 
===================================================================================

 . apt install [package]
 . apt remove [package]
 
 . sudo apt-get update 
    . REFRESHES THE LOCAL PACKAGE INDEX - the lists of latest available versions of packages
    . each of the common packages in Linux systems is in its own repository
    . every Linux distro is able to track the age of and other info about each package/version
    . with all this set up , a Linux distro does not have to pry answers out of the user with more prompts
    . we say that "these repositories are up-to-date and all dependencies are fixed" (if that is really the case) 
    
 . sudo apt-get upgrade
    . INSTALLS THE LATEST PACKAGES per the local package index 


apt vs. apt-get :
 . "`apt` is a newer, user-friendly command-line tool that combines and streamlines functions of older
   commands like `apt-get` and `apt-cache`, while `apt-get` is the traditional package management tool
   in Debian-based systems."
