 . linkers and object files - NOT ISA-agnostic
 => I want my linker to be able to produce executables for :
    . x86
    -> ARM Cortex-M
    -> RISC-V
    -> [my custom ISA] 
 
 . linkers are typically implemented in a HLL like C
 => a linker produces the executable , but it's the kernel that gets to store
    the executable (and needs disk drivers for that)
