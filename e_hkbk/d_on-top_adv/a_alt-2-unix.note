Is TempleOS an offshoot of Unix or an entirely independent system?
ChatGPT

TempleOS, also known as "LoseThos," is an entirely independent operating system created by Terry A. Davis. It is not an offshoot of Unix or based on any existing operating system. TempleOS was designed and implemented from scratch by Terry A. Davis with its own unique architecture, file system, programming language (HolyC), and user interface. It is a single-user, single-tasking system that aims to be a simple, lightweight, and self-contained operating system with a focus on ease of use and direct interaction with the hardware.
