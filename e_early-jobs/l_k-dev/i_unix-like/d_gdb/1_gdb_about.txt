There are a number of ways to debug a program :
 |
 . "print" statements - a looked-down-on brute force method 
 |
 . asserts
 |  . Bash and assembly do NOT support asserts 
 |
 . debugging software (VSCode debugger , GDB , etc.)



GDB, which stands for GNU Debugger, is a powerful command-line debugger for various programming languages, including C, C++, Ada, and others. It is part of the GNU Project and is widely used for debugging software during development. GDB allows developers to analyze and debug programs by examining their execution, inspecting variables, setting breakpoints, stepping through code, and more. It provides a range of features and commands to aid in the debugging process, making it a valuable tool for software developers.



It is absolutely necessary to know assembly if you want to use GDB.
