ORDERED JOURNALING : 
==================================================================================================================

 . introduced in 2001
 . with the release of the ext3 Linux file system
 . still used in various modern file systems
 . ordered metadata journaling is most common 



Logging :
  |
  .	     [changes in FS] ---> journal 
 -> (atomic) [     data    ] ---> file in FS 
 ->  atomic  [   metadata  ] ---> journal
 ->  atomic  [commit block ] ---> journal
 ->  	     [metadata change] ---> FS
 -> mark as completed in the JS-block 
 |
 |
 . metadata is updated later
    . "Crash consistency relies on the rule of “write the pointed-to object before the object that points to it”."
 => no dangling pointers 
 => recovery quality is fair 



  . CRASH -> file writing finished 	  => FS is corrupted 
  . file writing finished -> CRASH 	  => FS is secure 
  . CRASH -> metadata logging finished	  ? FS is NOT recoverable ?
  . metadata logging finished -> CRASH    ? FS is recoverable ?
