Can learning all PowerShell regular expressions and wildcards be transferred to learning Bash?
ChatGPT

While PowerShell and Bash both support regular expressions and wildcards, there are some differences in syntax and functionality between the two.

Regular Expressions:

    PowerShell and Bash use similar regular expression syntax, based on the POSIX Extended Regular Expression (ERE) standard.
    Many common regular expression patterns and operators are shared between PowerShell and Bash, such as character classes ([...]), quantifiers (*, +, ?), and anchors (^, $).
    However, there can be some differences in the interpretation of certain patterns or in the availability of certain features, so it's important to consult the documentation or references specific to the shell you are working with.

Wildcards:

    PowerShell and Bash have different wildcard syntax and behavior.
    PowerShell uses the -like operator with wildcards * and ? to perform pattern matching.
    Bash uses glob patterns with wildcards *, ?, and character ranges ([...]) for pattern matching.
    The syntax and behavior of wildcards can vary between the two shells, so it's necessary to understand the specific conventions used in each shell.

Although the concepts and patterns used in regular expressions are transferable between PowerShell and Bash, there may be some differences in syntax and behavior that require adjustment when switching between the two shells. Similarly, the wildcard syntax and behavior are specific to each shell.

Learning regular expressions and wildcards in PowerShell can provide a good foundation and understanding of the concepts, but it is recommended to consult the specific documentation and references for the shell you are working with to fully understand the syntax and behavior of regular expressions and wildcards in that shell.
