In the Bash shell, when you enter a backslash character ("") at the end of a line in the prompt string, it indicates that the command is continued on the next line. This behavior is known as "continuation prompt" or "secondary prompt."

When you press Enter after typing the backslash, the shell expects you to complete the command on the next line. The ">" angular bracket is the default continuation prompt in Bash, indicating that you should continue typing the command.

This feature is useful when you have a long command or need to break a command into multiple lines for better readability. The continuation prompt allows you to continue typing the command without executing it prematurely.

For example, if you have a command that spans multiple lines:

bash

$ echo "This is a long command \
> that continues on the next line."

In this case, the ">" prompt indicates that the command is not yet complete, and you can continue typing the rest of the command on the next line.

You can customize the continuation prompt by modifying the PS2 variable in your Bash shell. By changing the value of PS2, you can set a different prompt character or string for the continuation prompt according to your preference.
