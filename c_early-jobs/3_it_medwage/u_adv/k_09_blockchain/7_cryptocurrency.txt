  over fraud, money laundering, and lack of regulation.

Bitcoin is generally considered a better investment due to the utility it provides as 'digital gold'. Dogecoin is
  considered more of a short-term, speculative investment. Why is Dogecoin not a good investment? Dogecoin has an

Dogecoin has few technical advantages over Bitcoin, but it offers faster transaction times and lower fees, though
  it is primarily valued for community and meme culture.
