A:	A diode allows the current to flow only in one direction.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q:   	But doesn't current always flow in one direction? Under what circumstances
	would it change direction? 

A:   	"The common 120V 60Hz found on the wall outlets in civilized countries
	 changes direction 60 times [e]very second. It’s not "sudden", but it does
	 change." 

	"Another good example might be a circuit that normally supplies 13.5V DC
	 to your car’s headlights ... [then] the car suddenly gets hit by lightning
	 [but] that's a bit extreme."

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q:	Why would a current change direction?

A: 	"As the wire spins and periodically enters a different magnetic polarity,
	 the voltage and current alternate on the wire. This current can change
	 direction periodically, and the voltage in an AC circuit also periodically
	 reverses because the current changes direction."

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q:	Would I expect change of direction of current in both AC and DC?

A:	"[Typically,] direct current (DC) flows in one direction, resulting in a constant
	 polarity."

	"Alternating current (AC) flows half the time in one direction and half the time
	 in the other, changing its polarity 120 times per second with 60-hertz current."
