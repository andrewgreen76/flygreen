The functionality of applications (subordinate processes in a server) define the functionality of the server itself. 


Synchronous I/O :
 . an application issues an I/O request
 -> hands control over CPU (CPU resources - space and time) over to the kernel 
 -> enters a blocking state 
 -> DOES NOT RESUME until I/O op is completed 


Asynchronous I/O - the opposite :
 . an app issues an I/O request
 . the kernel only briefly uses the CPU to act on the request 
 . the app (process) quickly regains the CPU
 . carries on with the rest of the process/tasks while the I/O request is processed 


Status checks :
 . an app is at liberty to keep an eye on the progress of the I/O request
    . checks in on execution of certain I/O operations
