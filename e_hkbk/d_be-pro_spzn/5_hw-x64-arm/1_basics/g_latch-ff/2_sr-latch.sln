The set-reset (SR) latch consists of two smaller NOR gates ; they inform each other with their own output that will serve as an input to the other gate. In other words, the output of one gate will influence the input-output of the other gate.

The other inputs are induced in other ways (usually with a key press) :
- S (set)=1 will clear the lead to the exploit output Q' - an input to the other gate, - lighting up the focal output Q ;
- R (reset) will turn the tables, shutting off the signal to Q - an input to the other gate, - thus setting Q'. The exploit output Q' is now also a dump output. 



This way we achieve two things :
- RETENTION of the state, something we have not seen before until now.
  - This plays a crucial role in storing data in CPU cache registers, system memory, disk space, and flash memory. 
- Having one input do one thing only - producing an effect - and the other input do one thing only - reversing that effect.



Consists of 8+ transistors. 



SUMMARY :
|
- SR-latch : captures and loses electrical signal on command with two keys (the set key and the reset key)
  - solves : latching a data bit is possible 
  - problem : you are doing this with two keys instead of one
