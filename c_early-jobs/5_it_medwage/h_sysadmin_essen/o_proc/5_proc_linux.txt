PROCESSES IN LINUX - BASICS
===================================================================================

 . Every child is always with its own parent. Kill the parent and the children will die too.
 . a.k.a. parent-child relationship
 . everything is a file, even a process - in “/proc”


First processes in Linux:
 . "In Linux, the process with PID 0 is the scheduler (also known as the swapper), a kernel process responsible
      for managing CPU scheduling."
 . “init” has the PID of 1
 . “init”:
    . bootloader -> kernel -> init
    . The kernel starts init so that init can start other processes while the kernel is off doing other things.


Getting process info (including the PID):
 $ ps -x
 $ ps -ef    # -e : list all processes (including those by other users)
      	     # -f : full details
	     # UID : ID of the user who started the process
	     # PPID : ID of the parent process that started this child process
	     # C : the number of children this (parent) process has
	     # STIME : start time of the process
	     # TIME : CPU time taken up by the process

tty:
 . short for “teletype”
 . what it used to mean: teleprinter/telewriter, a device that transmitted messages over communication lines
 . what it means now: ANYTHING that provides communication with the system via text I/O, even if that thing
     is a terminal emulator
STAT:
 . process status
 . R - running / waiting to run
 . T - stopped (meaning “frozen”, not killed)
 . S - interruptible sleep (waiting for an interrupt (a specific event) to happen before getting back to work)
