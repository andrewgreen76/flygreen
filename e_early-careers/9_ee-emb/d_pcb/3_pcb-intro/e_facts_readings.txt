Measurement precision :
 . Specs on components (incl. power supplies) MAY BE INACCURATE , so it's a good idea to measure
   their properties personally. 
 . Cheap equipment is NOT that accurate. Some pieces of equipment are more accurate than others ,
   especially meters.
 . There are meters that vary by reading quality and versatility. 

Service integrity :
 . choose the more expensive multimeter over a cheap wall adapter (due to the latter's inaccurate readings)
