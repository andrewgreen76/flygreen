"jConnect" is a connectivity solution provided by Sybase, which allows Java applications to connect to Sybase databases. It is a JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) driver specifically designed for connecting Java applications with Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise (ASE) and Sybase SQL Anywhere databases.

jConnect provides a set of Java classes and interfaces that enable Java applications to establish a connection to Sybase databases, execute SQL statements, retrieve and manipulate data, and perform other database operations.

The jConnect driver supports various features such as connection pooling, transaction management, result set handling, and support for stored procedures. It provides an interface for Java applications to interact with Sybase databases using standard Java database APIs.

jConnect is widely used in Java-based applications that require connectivity to Sybase databases. It allows developers to leverage the capabilities of the Java programming language and the convenience of the JDBC API for database connectivity with Sybase databases.
