PREPARATIONS - MOCK INTERVIEW WITH SOMEBODY 
===================================================================================

 . the goal is to be mentally prepared so that you are able to give concise answers on the spot calmly 
 . Ask someone you know well who would be able and willing to devote time to do it ; they don’t necessarily
     have to know the content. Just provide them with your resume. 
   - prepare flash cards or a list of questions for them that you may be asked during the interview 
   - “Why do you like IT?” 
 . be ready for the “why” and the “how” on every subject 
 . get used to explaining technical things in non-technical terms 
 . have them throw troubleshooting scenarios at you , asking you to explain what you did when you fixed [something specific]
