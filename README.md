# Welcome to the experimental edutainment/multi-tutorial repository. 

__________________________________________________________________________
The PURPOSE of this repo:
__________________________________________________________________________

To help individuals, with or without a technical background, to:
- fill in the gaps left by their formal education or, if they didn't have any,
  provide them with comprehensive alternative education;
  - (especially for beginners)
    - hone their programming skills,
    - internalize key programming and engineering concepts,
    - learn about different systems,
    - understand and build a perspective on modern computing through studying
      its history.
- grow a portfolio; 
- improve their productivity in general (combatting ADD, figuring out
  alternatives to unhealthy solutions, etc.);
