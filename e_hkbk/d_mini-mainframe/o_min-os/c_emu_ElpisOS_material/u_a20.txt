Every 8086 machine can only access up to 2^20 = 1 MB of memory.

A20 ACCOMMODATING OLDER 20-BIT ADDRESING AND NEWER 24-BIT ADDRESSING
=======================================================================================

i286 :
 |
 . featured 24 address lines (0-23)
 |
 => on newer machines : would be able to access up to 16 MB of memory
 |
 . on older machines :
   . we wanted i286 to be backward-compatible with the 8086 HARDWARE
   |  => using A-lines 0-19 ; A20 had to be disabled by default
   |  . otherwise , memory wraparound through 0x0 would occur
   |
   . we wanted i286 to be backward-compatible with the 8086 SOFTWARE 
      . the aforementioned


========================================================================================
  
========================================================================================

REMEMBER :
 . all address lines are in the processor bus
 . address lines can be enabled and disabled (through code) - WHICH IS DIFFERENT FROM SETTING AND CLEARING

UNDERSTANDING THE A20 LINE 
========================================================================================

hardware perspective
on address lines
on I/O ports
I/O addressing is memory-like , but it's not memory
memory bussing vs. I/O bussing (addressing)  
I/O controllers
multiple I/O controllers
`in` , `out` <~> controllers

"
Yes, the `in` and `out` instructions are used for communicating directly with I/O controllers, allowing the CPU to read from and write to specific I/O port addresses associated with those controllers.
"

"
The CPU signals the I/O controller by placing the port address `0x92` on the address bus and activating the appropriate control signals to indicate a read operation, which prompts the controller to place the requested data onto the data bus for the CPU to retrieve.
"

"
A motherboard typically has multiple I/O controllers, including those for USB, SATA, audio, and network interfaces, with the exact number varying based on the motherboard's design and features.

A20 :
 |
 . 
 |
 . disabled on hardware by default - for the sake of compatibility with the older 8086 systems
 |  . they could only access up to 2^20 = 1MB of memory
 |  . 
 |
 . can be enabled to access 16 MB of physically avaliable RAM rather than the assumed 1 MB 
    . enabled through code
