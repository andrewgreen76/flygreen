... doping in semiconductor manufacturing is almost never done at room temperature; diffusion doping requires high
  temperatures (900–1200 °C) to drive dopant atoms into the silicon lattice, while ion implantation is done at lower
  temperatures but is always followed by a high-temperature anneal (typically 800–1100 °C) to repair crystal damage
  and electrically activate the dopants.
