Hi,

I am looking to pursue a career in software engineering with a focus on development of kernels, drivers, and GPUs. I already have a B.S. in CSE with games and simulations as my specialization, but I want to pivot. I know I need experience with firmware programming but I don't know where or who to turn to in this case. I also know a lot of companies are looking for students pursuing M.S. and already possessing the right skillset. (I've already been admitted for the Spring 2024 grad special program.)

What would you recommend? Do you believe turning to the companies at the upcoming fair would be a waste of time? People coming on behalf of EM Research and Horiba Semiconductors look like the best people to speak to. Or should I take certain classes with the aforementioned focus through the grad special program or the M.S. track (even though there isn't a dedicated program involving programming of systems and components)?
