... combinational logic is not a type of automaton, as it refers to a type of digital logic circuit that produces outputs based solely on the current inputs, without memory or state transitions, whereas automata involve states and transitions based on input sequences.
"

Side note : Sequential logic is based on combinational logic but you also
  need a clock to realize it.
