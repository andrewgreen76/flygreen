The tools and utilities involved in programming UEFI firmware into a motherboard's ROM can include:

1. UEFI Development Kits (UDKs): Development kits provided by chipset manufacturers or firmware vendors, containing tools, libraries, and documentation for UEFI firmware development.

2. Firmware Development Environment (FDE): Integrated development environments (IDEs) or command-line tools used for writing, compiling, and debugging UEFI code.

3. UEFI Shell: A command-line interface provided by some firmware vendors for interactive development and testing of UEFI applications and drivers.

4. UEFI Secure Boot Utilities: Tools for generating and managing Secure Boot keys, certificates, and security policies to ensure the integrity of the firmware during boot-up.

5. Flash Programming Tools: Software utilities or hardware devices for writing UEFI firmware images onto the ROM chip on the motherboard.

6. UEFI BIOS Editors: Software tools for editing and customizing UEFI BIOS settings, configurations, and boot options.

7. Manufacturer-Specific Tools: Proprietary tools or utilities provided by motherboard manufacturers for programming UEFI firmware onto their products, often tailored to their specific hardware platforms and firmware requirements.
