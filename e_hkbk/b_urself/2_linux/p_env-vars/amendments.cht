Can you give me some recommendations as to what I can put after the "@" symbol in place of the laptop model? What can I change "\h:" to?

Certainly! After the "@" symbol in the Bash prompt, you can include various pieces of information to customize your prompt further. Here are a few recommendations:

    Custom Text: You can replace \h with your own custom text or a descriptive label. For example:

    arduino

PS1='\u@MyMachine:\w\$ '

Short Hostname: If you prefer to display only the short hostname (without the domain), you can use \H. For example:

arduino

PS1='\u@\H:\w\$ '

Displaying IP Address: If you want to show the IP address of the machine, you can use \A or \@. For example:

arduino

PS1='\u@\A:\w\$ '

Removing Host Information: If you prefer to have only the username and working directory in your prompt, you can remove the hostname component altogether. For example:

arduino

    PS1='\u:\w\$ '

These are just a few suggestions to get you started. You can mix and match different elements or add additional information to suit your preferences. You can refer to the Bash documentation (e.g., man bash or online resources) for a comprehensive list of available escape sequences (\X) that can be used in the PS1 variable to customize your prompt.

Remember to save your changes and apply them by restarting your Bash session or sourcing the updated configuration file with source ~/.bashrc for the modifications to take effect.
