L1 CACHE (LEVEL 1 CACHE) : 
========================================================================================

"
Functionality: L1 cache is often divided into two sections: one for instructions (L1 instruction cache or L1i) and one for data (L1 data cache or L1d). This separation helps optimize instruction fetching and data access.
"

"
Purpose: L1 is primarily for rapid access to frequently used data and instructions. 
"

========================================================================================
L2 CACHE (LEVEL 2 CACHE) : 
========================================================================================

"
Location: L2 cache is generally situated within the CPU but outside the core. In some cases, it's shared across multiple cores, while in others, each core has its dedicated L2 cache.

Size: ... typically ranging from 256 KB to 1 MB per core, depending on the CPU design.

Speed: L2 caches are slower than L1 caches but faster than L3 caches, providing a middle ground in terms of latency and bandwidth.

Functionality: L2 cache generally holds a broader range of data and instructions than L1, often SERVING AS A BACKUP FOR CACHE MISSES at the L1 level. 
"

========================================================================================
L3 CACHE (LEVEL 3 CACHE) : 
========================================================================================

"
Location: L3 cache is usually shared among all cores in a CPU or a specific subset of cores (e.g., in multi-core or multi-chiplet architectures).

Size: ... typically ranging from 2 MB to 64 MB or more, depending on the CPU architecture.

Functionality: ... Its role is to maintain a common data pool for all cores, facilitating data sharing and reducing access to slower main memory.
