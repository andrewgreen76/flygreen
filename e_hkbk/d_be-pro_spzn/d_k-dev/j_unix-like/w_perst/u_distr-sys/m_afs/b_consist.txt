MAINTAINING CACHE CONSISTENCY : 
========================================================================================


 . server retains old copies of the same file 
 . working on the same file on different machines at the same time hardly every happens ,
   ... but when it does , ... 



Cache consistency in ITC : 
 . a cached copy is closed on a client 
 -> flushed to the server as the latest state 
 -> server invalidates all other cached copies
 -> breaks their callbacks 
 -> sends the latest state
 -> callbacks on the latest copies are established



Final state of file in AFS :
 |
 . "last closer wins" is the actual principle in AFS 
 |  . also called "last writer wins" for some reason 
 |  . whichever client closes its cached copy last has the latest state of the same file
 |  . last close = close on the last open fd  
 |  . all the copies on other clients are either gone or stored by the server (as temp files)
 |  => one client has the latest state 
 |
 . in contrast with NFS
    . individual block updates are flushed from all clients
    => final state of file is a mix of updates from all directions
