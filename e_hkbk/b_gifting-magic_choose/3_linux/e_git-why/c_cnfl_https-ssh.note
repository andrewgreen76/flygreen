If I want to start two repos from within the same private account, can I update one via HTTPS and the other via SSH from the terminal?
ChatGPT

Yes, you can update different repositories within the same private account using different protocols (HTTPS and SSH) from the terminal.

When you clone a repository, you can choose to use either HTTPS or SSH as the remote URL. If you clone a repository using HTTPS, you can push and pull changes using the HTTPS protocol. Similarly, if you clone a repository using SSH, you can push and pull changes using the SSH protocol.

To clone a repository using HTTPS, you can use the following command:

bash

git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git

To clone a repository using SSH, you can use the following command:

bash

git clone git@github.com:username/repository.git

Replace username with your GitHub username and repository with the name of the specific repository you want to clone.

Once you have cloned the repositories using the desired protocol, you can work with them separately, updating one repository via HTTPS and the other via SSH from the terminal, as per your preference.

If I use a private or classic token that is tailored for HTTPS repos and an SSH host key that is tailored for SSH repos, will these methods of security and access create any kind of conflict within my personal GitHub account?
ChatGPT

No, using a private or classic token for HTTPS authentication and an SSH host key for SSH authentication will not create any conflicts within your personal GitHub account. These are separate authentication mechanisms that are designed to work with different protocols and provide different levels of security.

Using a personal access token (PAT) for HTTPS authentication allows you to securely authenticate and access your GitHub repositories over HTTPS. It is a recommended method for authenticating with GitHub when using HTTPS.

On the other hand, using an SSH host key allows you to securely authenticate and access your GitHub repositories over SSH. SSH provides a more secure and convenient way to interact with remote repositories, especially for developers who frequently push and pull changes.

Using both HTTPS and SSH authentication methods will not conflict with each other or cause any issues within your GitHub account. You can use the appropriate method based on your needs and preferences for different repositories without any conflicts.
