`fopen()` and `open()` are both functions used for file handling in C, but they serve different purposes and have some key differences.

1. **Purpose:**
   - `open()`: The `open()` function is a low-level system call used to open files or devices. It returns a file descriptor that can be used for subsequent read or write operations.
   - `fopen()`: The `fopen()` function is a higher-level library function from the C Standard Library. It is used to open files and returns a `FILE*` pointer, which is a higher-level abstraction compared to file descriptors.

2. **Return Type:**
   - `open()`: Returns a file descriptor (`int`).
   - `fopen()`: Returns a `FILE*` pointer.

3. **Usage:**
   - `open()`: It is often used in conjunction with functions like `read()`, `write()`, and `close()` for low-level file operations. It is commonly used in Unix-like systems.
   - `fopen()`: It is used with higher-level file I/O functions like `fread()`, `fwrite()`, `fgets()`, and `fclose()`. It is part of the C Standard Library and provides a more portable and abstract interface.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - `open()`: Typically, errors are indicated by the return value of -1, and the specific error code is available in the `errno` variable.
   - `fopen()`: Errors are indicated by a `NULL` return value, and the specific error code can be obtained using `perror()` or `errno`.

Here's a simple example illustrating the use of `open()` and `fopen()`:

```c
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    const char *file_path = "example.txt";
    int fd;
    FILE *file_ptr;

    // Using open() to open the file
    fd = open(file_path, O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, 0666);
    if (fd == -1) {
        perror("open");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    write(fd, "Hello, open()", 13);
    close(fd);

    // Using fopen() to open the file
    file_ptr = fopen(file_path, "w");
    if (file_ptr == NULL) {
        perror("fopen");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    fprintf(file_ptr, "Hello, fopen()");
    fclose(file_ptr);

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `open()` is used for low-level file operations, while `fopen()` is used for higher-level file I/O operations. Each has its own use cases depending on the level of abstraction required in the application.
