Microprocessor:

    A microprocessor is a central processing unit (CPU) on a single integrated circuit that primarily focuses on executing instructions and performing general-purpose computing tasks.
    It is the core component of a computer system and requires external memory, peripherals, and additional circuitry to function as a complete system.
    Microprocessors are designed for more complex computing tasks and offer higher performance and flexibility compared to microcontrollers.
    They are commonly used in desktop and laptop computers, servers, high-end consumer electronics, and other devices that require general-purpose computing power.
