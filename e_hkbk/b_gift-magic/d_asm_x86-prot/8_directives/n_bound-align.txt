BOUNDARY , ALIGNMENT , etc. 
========================================================================================

Boundary :
 |
 . One part of the process of building a program is the system and its utilities storing 
 |   metadata and important information about source code in individual chunks of binary
 |   files. These chunks are called FIELDS and each field has its own BOUNDARY , the location
 |   where this field ends and the next one begins. 
 |
 . Fields have boundaries so that the system and the utilities would know where every
 |   specific field is. 
 |
 . The system maps out the fields by following certain schemes of building those binary files. 
 |
 . Such things can be easily inspected in hex dumps. 


Alignment :
 . a.k.a. boundary alignment
 . a.k.a. byte padding
 . this is simply to fill in unused byte addresses in a field (with 00s) before reaching
   the next field
   - boundary alignment overhead
   + without boundary alignment unused addresses would be saved but fields would be jam-packed
     and the system would have to work to zero in on the field of interest 


Alignment value :
