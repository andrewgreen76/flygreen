CHOSEN PROJECT: 
__________________________________________________________________________

- 13h-like mode portable to any headless system
  - challenge: faithful resolution
  - plan of attack:
    - fide: 320x200
    - now: 1920x1200, 6 times both ways.
    - consider fair, authentic scaling. 
- ? an API for the mode ? 
- learn BIOS-kernel-distro relationship for that
