Direct mapping for small (random) writes :
 . quick , direct mapping for every page 
 . more populated pages => more mappings 
    

Block-level mapping for large (sequential) writes : 
 . slow mapping (direct-to-block , then use offset) for every page
 . fewer mappings in the table



==========================================================================================
HYBRID MAPPING : 
==========================================================================================

Small, random write :
 . any one-page write fed to the SSD , unrelated to other writes 

Log block :
 . SSD's write "buffer"  
 . alleviates op load on actual target blocks
 . when full , its contents are committed to SSD 



==========================================================================================

Hybrid mapping - features dual record-keeping :
  |
 (1) the LOG TABLE - for small , random writes (laid down sequentially) 
  |  . just a few LOG BLOCKS are reserved
  |  
 (2) the DATA TABLE - for large , sequential writes
 
 . should reduce log-block count 



 . multiple pages <= multiples logical blocks mapped to the same block
 . one logical block <-> one physical page
