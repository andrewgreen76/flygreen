|
| . "The Global Descriptor Table (GDT) is a data structure in x86 architecture
|    that stores segment descriptors, providing memory segmentation information
|    such as base address, limit, and access permissions for memory segments
|    used by the CPU."
|
| . "The Local Descriptor Table (LDT) is a data structure in x86 architecture
|    similar to the GDT, but it is specific to a particular process and provides
|    additional memory segmentation capabilities beyond those available in the GDT."
