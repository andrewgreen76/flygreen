When I run a script that features that line of code with the operator, the Bash shell triggers a process that is killed after 10 seconds. Why?

The behavior you described, where running a script with the line of code "i for i in range(10**10)" causes the Bash shell to trigger a process that gets killed after 10 seconds, is likely due to the excessive memory usage and computational requirements of the range.

In this case, "range(10**10)" creates a range object with 10 billion elements, which consumes a significant amount of memory. Additionally, iterating over such a large range requires a considerable amount of computational resources.

When the script is executed, the Python interpreter attempts to generate the entire range before iterating over it. This leads to high memory consumption and computational overhead, which can exceed the limits imposed by the system or the shell environment.

As a result, the system or shell may terminate the process after a certain time (in your case, 10 seconds) to prevent excessive resource usage or potential system instability.

To avoid this issue, you can consider using alternative approaches that do not require generating and iterating over such a large range, or you can optimize your code to reduce memory usage and computational requirements.
