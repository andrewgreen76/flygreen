 . from the people who brought you the ENIAC


The nature of the computer : 
 . binary
 . serial computer
   . operating on 1 binary digit per cycle (they weren't called bits yet) 


Operations : 
 . automatic addition
 . subtraction
 . multiplication
 . programmed division
 . automatic checking


Memory : 
 . ultrasonic serial memory (totalling 1,024 44-bit words or 5.6 kilobytes)
 . a.k.a. delay-line memory
 . a sequence of acoustic waves propagated through a mercury column
 - heavy
 - expensive
 - data cannot be accessed randomly
 - temperature governs the flow of sound , but is difficult to regulate 


Performance : 
 . "average addition time was 864 microseconds and its average multiplication time was 2,900 microseconds"
