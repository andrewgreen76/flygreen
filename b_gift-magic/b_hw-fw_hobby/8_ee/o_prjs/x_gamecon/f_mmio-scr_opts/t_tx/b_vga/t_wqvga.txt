WQVGA stands for Wide Quarter Video Graphics Array. It is a display resolution standard that refers to a wide-screen version of the Quarter Video Graphics Array (QVGA). The "Wide" in WQVGA signifies that the aspect ratio is wider than traditional displays.

Here are the typical resolutions for WQVGA:

- **WQVGA (Portrait):** 240 x 400 pixels
- **WQVGA (Landscape):** 400 x 240 pixels

WQVGA is commonly used in small to medium-sized displays, such as those found in mobile phones, handheld devices, and some digital cameras. The wide aspect ratio makes it suitable for devices where a landscape orientation might be preferred, such as for browsing websites, viewing multimedia content, or playing games.
