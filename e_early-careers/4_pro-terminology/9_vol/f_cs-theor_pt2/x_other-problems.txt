Yes, there are several problems similar to the halting problem that are undecidable, meaning there is no algorithm or general procedure that can always solve them. Some notable examples include:

1. Rice's theorem: This theorem states that any non-trivial property about the behavior of a program is undecidable. In other words, it is impossible to write a program that can determine interesting properties of another program.

2. Post's correspondence problem: This problem involves finding a solution to a specific type of string rewriting system. It is known to be undecidable, meaning there is no algorithm that can always determine whether a solution exists.

3. Gödel's incompleteness theorems: These theorems, formulated by mathematician Kurt Gödel, show that in any formal system with sufficient expressive power, there will always be true statements that cannot be proven within the system.

Regarding literary works that explore these topics, there are various books, papers, and research articles written by mathematicians, logicians, and computer scientists that delve into the theoretical aspects of undecidability, computability, and related topics. Some classic works include "Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid" by Douglas Hofstadter, "The Emperor's New Mind" by Roger Penrose, and "Introduction to the Theory of Computation" by Michael Sipser.

Additionally, academic journals and conference proceedings in fields such as theoretical computer science, logic, and mathematics often contain research papers discussing these problems and their implications. Online resources, such as digital libraries and research repositories, provide access to a vast collection of literature exploring these topics.
