The process of determining the color inside every pixel cell on an LCD monitor involves several components and steps, which I'll outline below:

1. **Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)**:
   - The GPU is responsible for rendering graphics and generating the images that will be displayed on the screen.
   - It processes data from the computer's CPU and converts it into signals that can be sent to the display.

2. **Framebuffer**:
   - The framebuffer is a portion of the computer's memory dedicated to storing pixel data for the display.
   - The GPU writes pixel data to the framebuffer, specifying the color and intensity of each pixel.

3. **Color Depth**:
   - The color depth determines the number of colors that can be represented for each pixel.
   - Common color depths include 8-bit (256 colors), 16-bit (65,536 colors), 24-bit (16.7 million colors), and 32-bit (16.7 million colors with an additional alpha channel for transparency).

4. **Color Space and Color Gamut**:
   - Color space refers to the range of colors that can be represented.
   - Color gamut refers to the subset of colors within a color space that can be accurately reproduced.
   - LCD monitors typically adhere to standard color spaces such as sRGB or Adobe RGB, which define the range of reproducible colors.

5. **Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) Panel**:
   - The LCD panel consists of an array of liquid crystal cells, each associated with a pixel on the screen.
   - These cells can be manipulated to control the passage of light through individual pixels, allowing the intensity and color of each pixel to be adjusted.

6. **Backlighting**:
   - The backlighting system provides the illumination necessary for the display to be visible.
   - In an LCD monitor, the backlight is typically provided by LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) located behind the LCD panel.

7. **Liquid Crystal Alignment**:
   - Liquid crystals in each pixel cell are aligned by applying an electric field, which determines how much light can pass through.
   - By controlling the voltage applied to each pixel, the liquid crystals can be manipulated to modulate the intensity of light passing through them.

8. **Pixel Driving Circuitry**:
   - The pixel driving circuitry, often integrated into the LCD panel or the monitor's control board, applies voltages to individual pixels based on the pixel data received from the GPU.
   - These voltages control the orientation of the liquid crystals within each pixel, ultimately determining the color and brightness of the pixel.

In summary, the color inside every pixel cell on an LCD monitor is determined by a combination of factors including the pixel data generated by the GPU, the color depth and color space used, the liquid crystal alignment controlled by applied voltages, and the illumination provided by the backlighting system. All these elements work together to produce the images displayed on the screen with the desired color and intensity.

Individual pixels in an LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) monitor are colored using a combination of liquid crystal molecules and color filters. Here's how it works:

1. **Liquid Crystal Layer:** Each pixel in an LCD monitor contains a tiny cell filled with liquid crystal material. The liquid crystal molecules have the property of being able to change their orientation when an electric field is applied to them. This property allows them to modulate the passage of light through the pixel.

2. **Color Filters:** Behind each pixel's liquid crystal cell, there are three color filters: red, green, and blue (RGB). These filters are arranged in a pattern so that each pixel can display a wide range of colors by mixing different intensities of red, green, and blue light.

3. **Subpixels:** Each pixel on the screen consists of three subpixels, corresponding to the red, green, and blue color filters. By controlling the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules in each subpixel, the display controller can adjust the intensity of light passing through each color filter.

4. **Pixel Color Mixing:** To create a specific color, the display controller adjusts the intensity of the red, green, and blue subpixels in each pixel. By varying the voltage applied to each subpixel, the controller can produce a wide range of colors by mixing different intensities of red, green, and blue light.

5. **Color Gamut:** The combination of the RGB color filters and the ability to adjust the intensity of each subpixel allows LCD monitors to produce a wide range of colors, covering most of the colors in the visible spectrum. The specific range of colors that can be displayed is known as the color gamut of the display.

Overall, the combination of liquid crystal molecules, color filters, and subpixels allows LCD monitors to create colorful images by selectively controlling the passage of light through individual pixels on the screen.
