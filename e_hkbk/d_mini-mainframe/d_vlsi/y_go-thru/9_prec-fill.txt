The precision ['tool'] used for filling etched-out cavities with transistors and other semiconductor components is typically a deposition system. The specific type of deposition system commonly used for this purpose is called a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) system.

CVD systems enable the controlled deposition of thin films of semiconductor materials, such as silicon, onto the substrate surface. These systems operate by introducing precursor gases into a chamber where they react and deposit onto the substrate, forming a uniform layer of material.

In the context of filling etched-out cavities with transistors, CVD systems are used to deposit semiconductor materials into the trenches and wells created during the etching process. This allows for the formation of the active regions of transistors and other components within the semiconductor material.

CVD systems offer precise control over the deposition process, including deposition rate, film thickness, and material composition, ensuring uniform and high-quality deposition of semiconductor materials into the etched cavities.

In summary, for filling etched-out cavities with transistors and other semiconductor components, CVD systems are the precision tools of choice in semiconductor fabrication.
