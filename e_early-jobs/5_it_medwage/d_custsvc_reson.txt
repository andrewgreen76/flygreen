CUSTOMER SERVICE - POINTS OF RESONANCE 
===================================================================================

Reflect empathy. 
 . Show that you can IMAGINE WHAT THE USER MUST HAVE BEEN THROUGH.
For first-timers : 
 . [for the worst-case scenario:] "Missed some opportunities because of that ?"
 . "Couldn't get some work done ?"
 . "You lost any work in the process ?"
 . "Probably setting you back by quite a bit."
For repeat users : 
 . "Let me guess ..."
 . "Did you have to ... this time ?"


BEFORE TROUBLESHOOTING, 
 | 
 . Ask whether the user has COMMUNICATED DETAILS REGARDING THEIR PROBLEM PREVIOUSLY to somebody else. (Saves the repetition.) 
 . REFLECT THE VALUE IN THE INFORMATION THE USER PROVIDES to you. That includes A PERSONAL FACT. 
 |
 -> "If I may."
 |
 . VOCALIZE EVERY INTENTION you have for the device. 
 . GET KEY INFORMATION ON THEIR DEVICE (platform , browser of choice , etc.) 
 . ACCURATELY IDENTIFY THE ROOT CAUSE before fixing the issue ; separate your observations from what the user says. 
 . skip the small talk 


Acknowledge the user.
 |
 . When you are troubleshooting , THEY MAY BE WONDERING about your thought process. REFLECT YOUR THOUGHT
 |   PROCESS TO THEM. Give the user a bit of a detail regarding what you are doing exactly. PROVE IT TO THEM
 |   THAT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING. 
 |
 . During the call , KEEP THE USER UP-TO-DATE.
 |
 . skip the small talk 


Final notes :
 . reiterate the cause
 . reiterate the solution
 . clarify WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE next
 . clarify WHAT SHOULD **NEVER** BE DONE
 . "Do you have any questions , concerns , or reservations about the solution ?"
