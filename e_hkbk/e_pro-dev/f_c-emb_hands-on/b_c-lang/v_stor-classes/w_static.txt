What is the functional difference between a global variable and a static variable? Where is one preferred over the other?

Global variables and static variables are both used to create variables with a broader scope than local variables. However, they have different characteristics, and the choice between them depends on the specific requirements of the program. Here are the key differences:

1. **Scope:**
   - **Global Variable:** A global variable is visible and accessible throughout the entire program, including all functions and code files.
   - **Static Variable:** A static variable, when declared at the file level (outside any function), has file scope. This means it is accessible only within the file where it is defined.

2. **Visibility:**
   - **Global Variable:** Global variables are generally visible across multiple files. They can be accessed from any part of the program.
   - **Static Variable:** If a static variable is declared within a function, it is limited to that function's scope. If declared at the file level, its visibility is limited to that file.

3. **Storage Duration:**
   - **Global Variable:** A global variable has a lifetime equal to the entire program's execution.
   - **Static Variable:** A static variable also has a persistent lifetime, but its scope depends on where it is declared.

4. **Initialization:**
   - **Global Variable:** If not explicitly initialized, global variables are automatically initialized to zero or a default value by the system.
   - **Static Variable:** Similar to global variables, static variables are automatically initialized to zero if not explicitly initialized.

5. **Access Control:**
   - **Global Variable:** Global variables can be accessed and modified by any part of the program, which may lead to unintended side effects or difficulty in tracking changes.
   - **Static Variable:** The scope of a static variable can be limited to the file or function where it is declared, providing a degree of encapsulation and reducing the risk of unintended modification.

6. **Thread Safety:**
   - **Global Variable:** Accessing global variables across multiple threads may require synchronization mechanisms to ensure thread safety.
   - **Static Variable:** Similar to global variables, proper synchronization is needed if static variables are shared across threads.

**Preference:**
   - **Global Variable:** Use global variables when a shared state needs to be maintained across multiple files or when the variable's value needs to be accessible globally. Be cautious about potential naming conflicts and unintended modifications.
   - **Static Variable:** Use static variables when encapsulation within a file or function is desired, and the variable's value needs to persist but remain hidden from other parts of the program.

In general, it is considered good practice to minimize the use of global variables because they can lead to issues related to naming conflicts, maintainability, and unintended side effects. Static variables, especially when used within a limited scope, offer a degree of encapsulation and can be preferred in situations where a shared state is needed within a specific file or function.
