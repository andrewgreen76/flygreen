    Buffer Overflows: Occur when writing or reading data beyond the bounds of an allocated buffer, leading to memory corruption and potential arbitrary code execution.

    Integer Overflows/Underflows: Arise when integer values exceed their maximum or minimum limits, causing unexpected behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities.

    Format String Vulnerabilities: Occur when improperly formatted user input is passed as a format string argument, leading to information disclosure or arbitrary code execution.

    Use of Unsafe Functions: Using functions like strcpy, gets, or scanf without proper bounds checking can lead to buffer overflows and other vulnerabilities.




    Injection Attacks: Common examples include SQL injection, command injection, and format string injection, which occur when untrusted user input is directly used in constructing queries or command execution.

    Unvalidated Input: Failing to validate user input can lead to various security vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).

    Insecure Cryptography: Implementing weak or incorrect cryptographic algorithms or using insecure random number generators can compromise the security of sensitive data.

    Untrusted Data Handling: Lack of proper input validation, authentication, and authorization checks can allow untrusted data to affect program behavior or access unauthorized resources.

    Insecure Memory Management: Improper handling of memory allocation, deallocation, and pointers can result in memory leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities, or other memory-related security issues.

These vulnerabilities highlight the importance of secure coding practices, input validation, proper memory management, and adherence to secure programming guidelines to minimize the risk of security breaches and protect against potential exploits.
