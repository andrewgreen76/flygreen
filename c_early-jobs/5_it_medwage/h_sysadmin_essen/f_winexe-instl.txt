INSTALLATION EXECUTABLES FOR WINDOWS
===================================================================================

Flavors of executables:
 (a) files that guide the GUI Windows installer (wizard) to correctly install something 
 (b) independent custom installers, having nothing to do with an .msi file or the Windows installer and just
       running point on everything 


Microsoft’s portable executable (PE):
 . a format of an executable native to Windows
 . not just code and operands
 . regular text (e.g., comments)
 . embedded raw data (say, for an image) under the resources section (.rsrc)


Microsoft install package (MSI file):
 . the MSI file is used by Windows installer to generate instructions for setting up, maintaining, and removing the software


Windows installer bootstrapping: 
 . the triggered PE will in turn trigger, pass its own resources, and then pass control to (bootstrap) the Windows installer
