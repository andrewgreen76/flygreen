The `system` function in C is a standard library function that is used to execute a shell command. It allows a C program to invoke command-line commands as if they were entered directly in a terminal or command prompt.

Here's the general syntax of the `system` function:

```c
int system(const char *command);
```

- `command`: A pointer to a null-terminated string containing the command to be executed.

The `system` function returns an implementation-defined value that typically represents the termination status of the command executed. It returns `-1` if there is a system error.

Here's a simple example of using the `system` function to run a command:

```c
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    // Run the "ls" command on Unix-like systems or "dir" on Windows
    system("ls");  // or system("dir") on Windows

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `system` function is used to execute the "ls" command on Unix-like systems or the "dir" command on Windows. The exact behavior depends on the operating system.

It's important to note that the `system` function relies on the shell of the underlying operating system to execute commands. This means that the command string can include any valid shell command, including shell-specific features.

Be cautious when using user input to construct the command string, as it may expose your program to security vulnerabilities such as command injection. Consider using safer alternatives or validating user input thoroughly if needed.
