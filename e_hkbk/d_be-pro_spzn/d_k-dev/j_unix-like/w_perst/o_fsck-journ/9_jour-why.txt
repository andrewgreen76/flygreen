JOURNALING - LOGGING FILE WRITE OPS AS BACKUP : 
==================================================================================================================

 . a.k.a. write-ahead logging 
 . will come in handy in the event of a crash / power outage
 |
 . individual changes made to file by user = atomic units of work called TRANSACTIONS 
    = file write ops
    = write transactions
    = changes to FS  
 . the FS may decide to [ROLL BACK] file changes (revert write transactions to target) 
 . the FS may decide to [REPLAY] file changes (finish write transactions to target)
