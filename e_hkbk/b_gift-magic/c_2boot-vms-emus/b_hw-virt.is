Hardware virtualization, also known as hardware-assisted virtualization, is a technology that allows a computer's processor to create and manage virtual machines (VMs) more efficiently. It enables multiple operating systems (guests) to run simultaneously on a single physical machine (host) with each guest operating system isolated from the others.

In hardware virtualization, the processor's virtualization extensions, such as Intel VT-x (Intel Virtualization Technology) or AMD-V (AMD Virtualization), are used to enhance the performance of virtualization by providing hardware-level support for tasks like memory management, CPU scheduling, and I/O operations.

Advantages of hardware virtualization include:

    Performance: Hardware virtualization improves the performance of VMs by offloading virtualization tasks to dedicated hardware extensions.

    Isolation: Each virtual machine is isolated from other VMs and the host, providing security and preventing one VM's actions from affecting others.

    Compatibility: Hardware virtualization allows running guest operating systems that are not designed explicitly for virtualized environments.
