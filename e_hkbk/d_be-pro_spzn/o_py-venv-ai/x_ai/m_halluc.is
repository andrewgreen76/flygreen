In the context of LLM (Large Language Model), a hallucination refers to the generation of text that is not accurate or reliable. It refers to instances where the model produces outputs that may seem plausible but are not factual or consistent with the intended context. Hallucinations can occur due to limitations in the training data, biases present in the model, or the inherent nature of the language model's probabilistic generation process.

Hallucinations can be problematic when relying on LLMs for generating reliable information or making critical decisions. It is important to carefully evaluate the output of LLMs and cross-verify information from reliable sources to mitigate the risk of relying on inaccurate or misleading information.
