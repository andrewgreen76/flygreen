Is WWW a protocol or something else?

WWW (World Wide Web) is not a protocol itself, but rather a system of interconnected documents and resources accessible over the Internet. The WWW is based on a combination of protocols that work together to enable the retrieval and display of web pages.

The primary protocols associated with the WWW are:

    HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): HTTP is the foundation of data communication on the web. It is a protocol that defines how messages are formatted and transmitted between web servers and web browsers. HTTP facilitates the request and response process, allowing clients (browsers) to retrieve web pages and other resources from servers.

    HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): HTML is the standard markup language used to structure and present content on the web. It defines the elements, tags, and syntax used to format and organize web pages. HTML is responsible for creating the structure and layout of web documents.

    URL (Uniform Resource Locator): URL is a standardized format used to specify the address or location of a web resource. It includes the protocol (such as HTTP), domain name, and path to the specific resource on the server. URLs are used to navigate and access web pages and resources.

While WWW is not a protocol itself, it relies on protocols like HTTP, HTML, and URLs to function. These protocols work together to enable the retrieval, display, and interaction with web content, making the WWW accessible and navigable by users through web browsers.

In summary, the WWW is a system of interconnected web pages and resources, while protocols like HTTP, HTML, and URLs provide the necessary infrastructure and standards for accessing and interacting with those resources.
