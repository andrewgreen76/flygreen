The ratio of using the Bash shell versus an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) in Windows versus PowerShell in professional software development can vary depending on several factors, including the specific requirements of the development environment, the preferences of the developers, and the nature of the software being developed.

Traditionally, the Bash shell has been widely used in the Linux and macOS environments for software development, as it provides powerful command-line tools and scripting capabilities. However, with the increasing popularity of cross-platform development and the availability of tools like Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) on Windows, the usage of Bash on Windows has also seen growth.

On Windows, the usage of an IDE, such as Microsoft Visual Studio, JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA, or Eclipse, is quite common in professional software development. IDEs provide comprehensive development environments with features like code editing, debugging, version control integration, and project management, making them popular choices for many developers, regardless of the programming language or platform.

PowerShell, on the other hand, is a task automation and configuration management framework primarily designed for Windows. It provides a command-line shell and scripting language specifically tailored for Windows systems. PowerShell is commonly used for administrative tasks, system automation, and scripting within the Windows ecosystem. While it has gained popularity among system administrators and DevOps professionals, its usage in software development, particularly for non-Windows specific development, may be relatively limited compared to Bash or IDEs.

The actual ratio of usage between Bash, IDEs in Windows, and PowerShell in professional software development can vary significantly depending on the specific context, the development team's preferences, and the target platforms. Some developers may predominantly use IDEs for their convenience and productivity features, while others may opt for the flexibility and power of the command-line environment provided by Bash or PowerShell. It ultimately depends on the individual developer's workflow, the project requirements, and the technologies involved.
