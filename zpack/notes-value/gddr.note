What is located in graphics double data rate memory?
ChatGPT
Graphics double data rate (GDDR) memory is a type of high-speed memory specifically designed for use in graphics processing units (GPUs). GDDR memory is optimized for the large amount of data processing required by graphics-intensive applications like video games, video rendering, and scientific simulations.

The type of data stored in GDDR memory includes the graphics data that is processed by the GPU, such as textures, shaders, and framebuffers. GDDR memory also stores the intermediate results of GPU calculations, which can be used to improve the performance of subsequent calculations.

GDDR memory is typically used as the primary memory for GPUs, and its high-speed and high-bandwidth characteristics make it well-suited for handling the large amounts of data required by modern graphics applications.
