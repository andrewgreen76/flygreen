The SR latch (also known as the set-reset latch or basic flip-flop circuit) traces its origins to 1918, when British
physicists William Henry Eccles and Frank Wilfred Jordan invented the first electronic bistable multivibrator — called
the Eccles–Jordan trigger circuit — using two vacuum tubes with cross-coupled feedback, creating the fundamental cross-
-coupled pair topology that is still used today in modern NOR- or NAND-based SR latches. This circuit, patented in 1918
(published 1920), was initially intended for relay-like applications in telegraphy and telephony, but became the
cornerstone of digital memory and sequential logic decades later, notably in early computers like the 1943 Colossus.
The specific name "SR latch" and its standardized description in terms of set/reset inputs emerged much later (especially
popularized in the 1950s through works like Montgomery Phister's teaching and 1958 book Logical Design of Digital
Computers).
