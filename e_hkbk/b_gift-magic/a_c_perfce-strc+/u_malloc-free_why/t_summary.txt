Things to remember about malloc()/free() :
- Need <stdlib.h>
- malloc() is a raw function. For every malloc() there has to be a free().
- malloc() does not work 100% of the time;
  - its success/failure must always be checked (to avoid invalid free).
- Never repeat free() or you'll end up with an undefined behavior (double free).
