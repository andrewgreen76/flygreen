At room temperature phosphorus exists in several allotropes - white (waxy, yellowish, highly reactive solid),
  red (powdery, reddish-brown solid), and black (shiny, crystalline solid) - while during doping it is typically
  introduced as a colorless, toxic gas (phosphine PH₃ or phosphorus oxychloride POCl₃) that decomposes at high
  temperature (800–1100 °C) to release atomic phosphorus into the silicon.

"
An allotrope is a different physical form or structural arrangement of the same chemical element (e.g., diamond
  and graphite are allotropes of carbon, or white, red, and black phosphorus are allotropes of phosphorus) that
  exhibits distinct properties despite having identical atoms.
"


"
One sentence: Allotropes are different because the same element’s atoms are bonded and arranged in distinct
  crystalline or molecular structures (e.g., carbon atoms form tetrahedral sp³ bonds in diamond vs. planar sp²
  hexagonal layers in graphite), which fundamentally changes bond strength, electron distribution, density,
  hardness, conductivity, color, and other physical/chemical properties.
