BENEFITS OF HASHING
===================================================================================

 . Passwords are not to be stored in plaintext anywhere, including a database server where it can be stolen.
 . If an attacker finds out they can steal your cookies, they can steal the cookies of others and realize
     that the whole database is fair game.
 . Instead, store a hash digest of the password, which would be pretty much impossible to recover the password
     from.
 . Though a hacker may have access to the hash digests, the database's hashing function requires an actual
     password as the input, so having the hash digests of those passwords would be rather useless.


Hashing complexity:
 . The tougher the hashing function, the more resource intensive a brute force attack would have to be.
 . Time (a sufficient time frame) and resources (techological resources) are to be accounted for when raising
     concerns over brute force attacks.


Chain hashing:
 . can make hacking efforts much, much more frustrating
 . feed the output as input through a hashing function many, many times
