Although your solution involving the executable script opening a URL did work, the Bash shell issued the following: "Gtk-Message: 12:40:50.620: Not loading module "atk-bridge": The functionality is provided by GTK natively. Please try to not load it." Is there anything I should do about this?

The warning message you received, "Gtk-Message: Not loading module 'atk-bridge'," is related to the GTK accessibility module. This message indicates that the module "atk-bridge" is not required because the functionality it provides is already available natively in GTK.

In most cases, this warning can be safely ignored. It is a benign message and does not typically affect the functionality of the script or the application (in this case, Mozilla Firefox) being launched.

However, if you wish to suppress the warning message, you can set the GTK_MODULES environment variable to exclude the "atk-bridge" module. You can modify your script as follows to achieve that:

bash

#!/bin/bash

# Check if a URL is provided as an argument
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "Please provide a URL as an argument."
  exit 1
fi

# Get the URL from the command-line argument
url=$1

# Set GTK_MODULES environment variable without atk-bridge
export GTK_MODULES=${GTK_MODULES/atk-bridge:/}

# Open the URL in Mozilla Firefox
firefox "$url"

By setting GTK_MODULES to exclude the "atk-bridge" module, the warning message should no longer appear when running the script.

Again, please note that this warning message is typically harmless and does not affect the functionality of your script or the application it launches.
