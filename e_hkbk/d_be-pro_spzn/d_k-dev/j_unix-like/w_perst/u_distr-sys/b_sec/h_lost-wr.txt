LOST WRITES : 
========================================================================================


 . a write did not reflect on the recipient disk
    . an integrity check for every disk-to-disk write
       . phys.IDs 
       . checksums 
       . a.k.a. write verify
       . a.k.a. read-after-write
       - it's another I/O operation => I/O footprint doubles 

 . a write can be flagged as completed even when the incoming data is lost



Another checksum can be added to ensure the write actually happened. 
 . an addl chksum in every inode
 . an addl chksum in every indirect block
 + another redundancy for spotting a lost write
 . the inode has a great likelihood of actually getting written in
 . the data block - not so much
 > mismatch : inode's checksum =/= computed checksum 
 - fails when both the inode (w/ the checksum) and the data block are lost
 |  . ... but that's highlt unlikely
