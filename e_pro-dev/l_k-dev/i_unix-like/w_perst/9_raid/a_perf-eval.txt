RAID PERFORMANCE EVALUATION :
=================================================================================

Performance - depends on : 
 . seeking + rotation + transfer 
 . workload amount
 . workload management method (random vs. sequential)


Single-request latency :
 . time length of response to an I/O request


Steady-state throughput :
 . amount of data transferred across all disks at a certain time interval


Sequential requests (requests involving adjacent blocks) - suitabale for a single disk.
|
Random workload - solved with parallelism.
 . random workload on the same single disk (pair) - bad news
 <= greater positioning times
