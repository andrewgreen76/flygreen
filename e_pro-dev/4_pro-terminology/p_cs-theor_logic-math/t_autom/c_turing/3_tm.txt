Turing(-complete) machine - able to process. 


===================================================================================
TURING MACHINE 
===================================================================================

 . an abstract model of the perfect machine 
 |
 + memory : infinite memory		(tape) 
 . I/O medium : read/write head 
 + logic - rules to execute - algorithm - processing abilities :
    . the perfect algorithm that can help solve (just about) any problem
       . there are problems that are unsolveable 
    . able to perform general-purpose computations - do a lot of things 
    . (rules for transition between states)

 . Processing takes time , so the output is NOT immediate. 


===================================================================================
TURING-COMPLETE MACHINE 
===================================================================================

 . a real-world machine
 . modelled after the Turing machine - but with limitations 
 |
 . limited memory
 . a processor with limited architecture and limited decoding logic (limited
     computation abilities)
 . needs enough time and memory to solve any one particular problem 


===================================================================================
TURING-INCOMPLETE MACHINE 
===================================================================================

 . calculator
 . digital watch
 . digital thermostat
 . a vending machine
 . Coq programming language
 . Agda programming language 

"
Actually, there are many examples of Turing-incomplete machines, such as a digital watch that only tracks time, a basic thermostat, or a vending machine with a fixed set of operations. Each of these systems lacks the ability to simulate a Turing machine because they have limited functionality and do not support general-purpose computation.
