Besides PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express), there are several other I/O (Input/Output) buses used in computer systems and embedded devices to connect various peripherals and components. Some of the common I/O buses include:

1. USB (Universal Serial Bus): USB is one of the most widely used I/O buses for connecting peripherals such as keyboards, mice, printers, external storage devices, and more. It provides a versatile and hot-pluggable interface with different versions like USB 2.0, USB 3.0, and USB 3.1.

2. SATA (Serial ATA): SATA is primarily used for connecting internal storage devices like hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), and optical drives to the motherboard. It is commonly used in desktops and laptops.

3. Thunderbolt: Thunderbolt is a high-speed I/O bus that combines PCIe and DisplayPort into a single interface. It is commonly used in Mac computers and high-performance peripherals.

4. FireWire (IEEE 1394): FireWire is an older high-speed I/O bus that was commonly used for connecting audio and video devices, external hard drives, and other peripherals. It has been largely replaced by USB and Thunderbolt.

5. eSATA (External SATA): eSATA is an external version of the SATA interface, used for connecting external storage devices like HDDs and SSDs with faster data transfer rates than USB.

6. Ethernet: Ethernet is a widely used networking standard that enables devices to communicate with each other over local area networks (LANs) and the internet. It is commonly used for connecting computers, servers, switches, routers, and other network devices.

7. HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface): HDMI is commonly used for transmitting audio and video signals from devices like computers, gaming consoles, and media players to displays like monitors, TVs, and projectors.

8. DisplayPort: DisplayPort is another interface used for transmitting audio and video signals between computers and displays, offering high-resolution and multi-monitor support.

9. SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface): SPI is a synchronous serial communication interface used for connecting microcontrollers and other digital devices to peripheral chips like sensors, displays, and memory devices.

10. I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit): I2C is a two-wire serial communication protocol commonly used to connect microcontrollers and other digital devices to peripherals with relatively low data transfer rates.

These are just a few examples of I/O buses used in different applications. Each I/O bus serves specific purposes and provides different capabilities, catering to various devices and their connectivity requirements. The choice of the I/O bus depends on the application, data transfer speed, distance, and compatibility with the connected devices.
