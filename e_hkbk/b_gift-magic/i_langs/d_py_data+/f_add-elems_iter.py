l = []
l += "Python"
print(l)

'''
In the provided script, the line `l += "Python"` attempts to concatenate the string `"Python"` to the list `l` using the `+=` operator.

However, since the left-hand side operand `l` is a list and the right-hand side operand `"Python"` is a string, the `+=` operator behaves differently depending on the data types involved.

When the `+=` operator is used with a list as the left-hand side operand and a string as the right-hand side operand, it treats the string as an iterable and adds each character of the string as separate elements to the list.

Therefore, the resulting behavior is as follows:

1. Initially, the list `l` is empty: `[]`.
2. The `+=` operator attempts to add each character of the string `"Python"` to the list `l`. Since `"Python"` is iterated character by character, the resulting list will contain each character as separate elements.
3. After the operation, the list `l` will contain the individual characters of the string `"Python"`: `['P', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n']`.

So, the output of `print(l)` will be `['P', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n']`.
