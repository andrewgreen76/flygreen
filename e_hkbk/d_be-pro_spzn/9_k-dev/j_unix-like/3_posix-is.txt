POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) standards define a set of specifications to ensure compatibility and portability across Unix-like operating systems. Some of the key POSIX standards include:

1. **POSIX.1:**
   - Specifies the fundamental interface and environment for Unix-like operating systems.
   - Defines basic functionalities such as file I/O, process control, signals, and system utilities.

2. **POSIX.1b (Real-time Extensions):**
   - Adds real-time extensions to the original POSIX.1 standard.
   - Introduces real-time signals, clocks, and timers.

3. **POSIX.1c (Threads Extensions):**
   - Defines thread-related functions for multithreading support.
   - Specifies thread creation, synchronization, and control.

4. **POSIX.1d (Security):**
   - Introduces security-related extensions.
   - Defines security controls and privileges.

5. **POSIX.1g (Networking Services):**
   - Adds networking-related interfaces.
   - Defines socket and network-related functions.

6. **POSIX.2 (Shell and Utilities):**
   - Specifies the shell and utilities interfaces.
   - Defines commands, utilities, and their syntax.

7. **POSIX.2a (Enhanced Batch Processing):**
   - Introduces extensions for batch processing.

8. **POSIX.2c (Additional Real-time Extensions):**
   - Further extends real-time support.

9. **POSIX.2d (Profile: POSIX.2 and ISO/IEC 9945-2):**
   - Profiles POSIX.2 and ISO/IEC 9945-2 standards.

10. **POSIX.1e (System Administration):**
    - Adds system administration interfaces.

11. **POSIX.1f (Real-time Systems Profiling):**
    - Specifies profiling interfaces for real-time systems.

12. **POSIX.1i (IEEE Std 1003.1i, POSIX Access Control Lists):**
    - Introduces Access Control Lists (ACLs) for file permissions.

13. **POSIX.1j (IEEE Std 1003.1j, Extensions for Batch Processing):**
    - Adds further extensions for batch processing.

14. **POSIX.1k (IEEE Std 1003.1k, Real-time Safety):**
    - Introduces safety-related features for real-time systems.

15. **POSIX.1p (IEEE Std 1003.1p, User Portability Extensions):**
    - Adds extensions for user portability.

These are just a few examples of POSIX standards. Each standard addresses specific aspects of the operating system interface, providing a comprehensive framework for interoperability among Unix-like systems. It's important to note that compliance with POSIX standards helps ensure that software written to these standards can run on various POSIX-compliant operating systems.
