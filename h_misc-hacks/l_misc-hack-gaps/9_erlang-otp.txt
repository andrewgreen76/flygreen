Erlang was originally developed at Ericsson in the late 1980s by Joe Armstrong, Robert Virding, and Mike Williams. It was created as a proprietary programming language for building highly concurrent, fault-tolerant, and distributed telecommunications systems. The main goal was to address the challenges of building real-time, reliable, and scalable systems for telecom applications.

Telecommunications systems require high availability, as they deal with critical services like voice calls and messaging. They also need to handle a large number of concurrent connections and efficiently process data from various sources. Traditional programming languages of the time did not provide the necessary concurrency and fault-tolerance features to meet these demands.

Erlang's design philosophy focused on the following key aspects:

1. Concurrency: Erlang was designed to handle massive concurrency with lightweight processes (actors) and message passing. This allowed developers to build systems that could handle thousands of simultaneous tasks efficiently.

2. Fault Tolerance: Erlang introduced the concept of supervisors and the "let-it-crash" philosophy. When an error occurs, Erlang processes can be quickly terminated and restarted, ensuring that the system remains operational.

3. Distributed Computing: Erlang was designed to support distributed computing across multiple nodes, allowing developers to build scalable and fault-tolerant distributed applications.

Over the years, Erlang gained popularity beyond telecommunications and found applications in various domains, such as web development, real-time systems, financial services, and messaging platforms. Its unique features make it well-suited for building systems that require high concurrency, fault tolerance, and scalability. Today, Erlang is widely used in both telecom and non-telecom industries, and its open-source implementation, called OTP (Open Telecom Platform), is available for developers to use and contribute to.
