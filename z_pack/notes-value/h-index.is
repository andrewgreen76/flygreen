What is the H-index?

The h-index is a metric used to measure the research impact and productivity of a scientist or scholar. It was proposed by physicist Jorge E. Hirsch in 2005 as a way to quantitatively assess the quality and significance of a researcher's work.

The h-index is calculated based on the researcher's publication record. It is defined as follows: A researcher has an h-index of h if they have h publications that have each been cited at least h times. In other words, it indicates that the researcher has published h papers that have each received at least h citations.

For example, if a researcher has an h-index of 20, it means that they have published 20 papers that have each received at least 20 citations.

The h-index is used as a measure of both the productivity and impact of a researcher's work. It takes into account both the number of publications and the number of citations those publications have received. A higher h-index generally indicates a greater impact and influence within the research community.

It's important to note that the h-index is not without limitations and criticisms. It can be influenced by factors such as the field of research, publication practices, and citation patterns. Additionally, it does not provide a comprehensive assessment of the quality or impact of individual publications. Therefore, it is often used in conjunction with other metrics and qualitative evaluations to provide a more comprehensive view of a researcher's work.
