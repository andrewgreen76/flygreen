FILE SYSTEMS (FS) 
===================================================================================

Every OS organizes files in its own way - using its own FILE SYSTEM - on a storage drive (even a thumb drive).

REFORMATTING a storage drive :
 . erasing all data on the drive and configuring it to a specific file system

Different file systems are OPTIMIZED FOR DIFFERENT PURPOSES. 

Flavors :
 . on Windows - NTFS :
    . focus on security and encryption
    . focus on faster access speeds
 . on a Mac - APFS
 . on a Linux machine - there are different file systems ;
    . the predominant FS on Linux machines in general is `ext4`
    . ext4 is backward-compatible with older `ext` file systems

Data storage :
 . Whatever the FS , data is stored in DATA BLOCKS that DO NOT HAVE TO BE CONTIGUOUS.
 . This BLOCK STORAGE method means immediately writing data to a disk instead of spending time looking
     for a region of vacant contiguous blocks on the drive.
