RAID 5
===========================================================================================================

 . MOST COMMON RAID SETUP
    . fast
    . capacious 
 . a.k.a. rotating parity 
 . similar to RAID 4
 . but parity information is distributed across all disks instead of being stored on a dedicated disk
 
 + room for one more regular disk
 +> wider I/O throughput (better parallelism)
 - but parity chunks take up space on every disk
 - the intricate arrangement of parity chunks across disks complicates I/O operations


	   [d0]  [d1]   [d2]  ...

			      ...
		       P(N-2)
		P(N-1)
	   P(N)
   

Evaluation :
 . reliability - same as RAID 4
 . capacity - same as RAID 4
   . sum of parity information size across all disks = size of parity disk = (N-1)*B
