An HDD can have 1+ platters. 


Platter :
 . a circular storage medium
 . made of aluminum 
 . both surfaces of a platter have magnetic coating
 . magnetic variations write in and erase bits
 . secured with a single spindle connected to a motor
    . rotated counter-clockwise 
    . speed is measured with RPM (rotations per minute)
    . 7,200-15,000 is the norm 
 |
 |
 . every PLATTER has two surfaces
 . every SURFACE has thousands of concentric circles - tracks
    . modern HDDs have millions of tracks 
 . every TRACK has multiple clusters (arcs) 
 . every CLUSTER has two sectors
    . cluster - smallest storage unit for a file 
 . stacked tracks from different platters make up a CYLINDER
 |
 . every surface has an assigned disk HEAD which makes magnetic patters on the disk
 . the disk ARM (a.k.a. actuator arm) moves the head



Three stages of reading from / writing to (R/W) a disk :
 |
 . SEEK :
    . move the head to the right track
    . an expensive disk operation 
 . ROTATION :
    . have the head wait for the right sector (rotational delay)
    . worst-case scenario - near-full rotational delay
    . an expensive disk operation 
 . TRANSFER - R/W itself
