What I need (functions) :
 |
 |
 . prologue : 
 |  . f: clear the screen
 |  . f: enable non-canonical mode (must share global termst with prologue)
 |
 . epilogue : 
 |  . f: disable non-canonical mode
 |  . f: clear the screen
 |
 . get certain keybindings working : 
 |  . EOT (to exit) 
    . top menus access 
 |
 . get char keys working : 
    . backspace
    . cursor-moving arrow keys 
    . tab
 

What I ran into :
 . backspace not working
 . arrow keys generate strange sequences - explicit ANSI escape codes ;
    . can't move the cursor 
 . reaction to [tab] as EOF
