ROOT CA's and CHAIN OF TRUST
===================================================================================

PKI relies on a chain of trust between nodes.
 |
 . starts with the Root Certificate Authority
 . the root certs are self-signed ... because no one other node is going to verify them
 . root CA certs are shipped (read: distributed) with their native OS
 . browsers will follow, like dominoes
 |
 . the root CA has a private key
 . uses its own private key to approve public keys and issue certs
 . every cert signed by root CA has the "CA" field
 . "CA"=true => the cert is a interm./subordinate CA => the entity with the cert. can sign other certs => has as much
    clout as the root CA.
 . an intermediary CA can help generate and work with other intermediary CA's
 . End-entity / leaf cert. = guess what that is.


The root CA certs would have to be distributed in the first place.
 . shipped with OS's
 . browsers can lead to the store sponsored by the OS where these certs are hosted
