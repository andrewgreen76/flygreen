ROUTING PROTOCOLS : 
===================================================================================

 . for learning about neighboring networks  through neighboring routers 
 . for updating the routing table with shortest paths 
 . "implemented based on specifications published by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)"
 

Interior gateway protocols :
 |
 . used by routers to share information within the same autonomous system 
 . routers only have information on neighboring routers , not all the routers in the autonomous system
 |
 . (a) distance-vector protocols 
       - older standard 
       . every router shares its routing vector with the neighboring routers 
       - because of this updating a routing vector in a router takes too long
       . ex.: RIP, or Routing Information Protocol (IETF RFC2453)
       . ex.: EIGRP, or Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (Cisco documentation)
 . (b) link state routing protocols 
       . Each router shares the state of the link to each one of its own interfaces. This info is shared
       	 with every router in the autonomous system. 
       -> Then every router recomputes the shortest path to every destination network in the routing table
       	  using sophisticated algorithms. 
       + faster update time 
       - requires more resources
       . ex.: "The most common link state protocol is OSPF, or Open Shortest Path First (IETF RFC2328)."


Exterior gateway protocols : 
 . used by **edge routers** to exchange information between autonomous systems (administered by different organizations) 
 . an edge router connects a core router (in a cluster of interconnected core routers) to its own autonomous system
 . the purpose of core routers is to get data from and feed data to edge routers
 . There's only one - BGP, or Border Gateway Protocol (IETF RFC4271).
