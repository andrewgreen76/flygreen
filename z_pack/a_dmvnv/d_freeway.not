- Be mindful of the changes all around. 
- Changing lanes => turn signal , mirror , over the shoulder for the blind spot. 
- Look ahead 20-30 secs.



Entrance ramp meters
- STOP at the read light
- 2+ people => HOV , you can use the carpool lane , don't stop



Exiting : 
- a mile+ before the exit :
  do NOT slow down , merge , THEN match the speed limit.
- If you miss the exit :
  > get off on the next one,
  > get back on in the opposite direction,
  > get off at the intended exit.
