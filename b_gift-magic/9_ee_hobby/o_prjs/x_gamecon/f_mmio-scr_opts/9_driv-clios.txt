Yes, Raspberry Pi can support operating systems without a graphical user interface (GUI). In fact, many operating systems available for Raspberry Pi, such as Raspbian Lite, Ubuntu Server, and Arch Linux ARM, are designed to run without a GUI.

These lightweight operating systems are suitable for headless applications, servers, embedded projects, and scenarios where graphical capabilities are not required. They typically offer a command-line interface (CLI) for system administration and application management, allowing users to interact with the system via text-based commands.

Running an operating system without a GUI can be beneficial for certain use cases where resources are limited, power consumption needs to be minimized, or the system needs to be optimized for specific tasks that don't require graphical capabilities.
