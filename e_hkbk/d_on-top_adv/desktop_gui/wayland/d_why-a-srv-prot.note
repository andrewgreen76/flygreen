Why is Wayland called a protocol?
ChatGPT

Wayland is referred to as a protocol because it defines a standardized set of rules and mechanisms for communication and interaction between client applications and the display server. The protocol specifies how client applications can create and manage windows, handle input events, and render graphics on the display.

In the context of Wayland, the protocol defines a structured format and a series of messages that client applications and the display server use to exchange information and commands. This communication happens over a well-defined interface, facilitating the interaction between the components involved in graphical display.

By being a protocol, Wayland enables interoperability between different components of the system. Client applications that adhere to the Wayland protocol can communicate with any compliant Wayland display server, regardless of the specific implementation details. This allows for modularity and flexibility, as it separates the client applications' responsibilities from those of the display server.

The term "protocol" highlights the standardized nature of Wayland, emphasizing that it provides a defined set of rules and conventions for communication between software components. By adhering to the Wayland protocol, developers can ensure compatibility and consistent behavior across different implementations of Wayland on various Linux distributions and desktop environments.



Where in the operating system is this server? Is it a program?

In an operating system that uses Wayland as the display server protocol, the Wayland server, also known as the display server or compositor, is a program that runs as a part of the operating system. It typically operates at a low level, close to the kernel or within the user session, depending on the specific implementation.

The Wayland server is responsible for managing graphical display and input handling, including window management, compositing, handling input events, and coordinating the rendering of windows and graphics on the screen. It interacts with client applications that utilize the Wayland protocol to request services and provide information.

The Wayland server program is typically started when the user logs in or when the graphical environment is launched. It runs as a background process and handles the core functionality of managing graphical display. The server communicates with client applications using the Wayland protocol, exchanging messages and commands to perform tasks such as creating and manipulating windows, handling input events, and rendering graphics.

Different Wayland-based desktop environments or distributions may use different Wayland server implementations. For example, Weston is the reference implementation of Wayland and serves as a standalone Wayland server. Other desktop environments, such as GNOME Shell with its Mutter compositor or KDE Plasma with its KWin compositor, have their own Wayland server implementations integrated into their respective environments.

In summary, the Wayland server is a program that runs within the operating system and acts as the core component responsible for managing graphical display and input handling in a Wayland-based system.
