The Motorola 68010 microprocessor was introduced in 1982. It was part of the Motorola 68000 series of microprocessors and served as an incremental improvement over the original Motorola 68000. The 68010 featured a few enhancements over its predecessor, including support for virtual memory and an enhanced MOVE instruction. It also introduced a new exception handling mechanism, which improved the processor's reliability and error handling capabilities. The 68010 found use in various computing devices, including personal computers, embedded systems, and industrial controllers. However, it was not as widely adopted as later members of the 68000 family due to its limited improvements over the original 68000.

The Motorola 68010 microprocessor was used in several personal computer models during the 1980s. Here are some notable examples:

1. **Commodore Amiga 2000:** The Commodore Amiga 2000, introduced in 1987, featured the Motorola 68010 CPU. It was a mid-range model in the Amiga series and offered enhanced graphics and expandability compared to earlier models.

2. **Sinclair QL:** The Sinclair QL, introduced by Sinclair Research in 1984, used the Motorola 68008 CPU, which is a variant of the 68000 series. However, some later models of the QL were equipped with the 68010 processor.

3. **Apollo/Domain:** The Apollo/Domain series of workstations, introduced by Apollo Computer in the mid-1980s, used the Motorola 68010 CPU. These workstations were primarily used in engineering, scientific, and research applications.

4. **Hewlett-Packard HP 9000/300 series:** Some models in the HP 9000/300 series of workstations, introduced by Hewlett-Packard in the mid-1980s, used the Motorola 68010 CPU. These workstations were used in various business and technical computing applications.

5. **Intergraph InterPro 32:** The Intergraph InterPro 32 workstation, introduced in the late 1980s, used the Motorola 68010 CPU. It was used in engineering, graphics, and CAD/CAM applications.

These are just a few examples of personal computer models that featured the Motorola 68010 microprocessor. The 68010 was an incremental improvement over the original 68000 and offered enhanced capabilities for personal computing and workstation applications.
