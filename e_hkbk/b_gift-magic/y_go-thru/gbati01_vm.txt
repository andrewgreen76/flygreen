
 . the most basic function of a computer : to execute code (programs) 


===================================================================
THE VIRTUAL MACHINE CONCEPT 
===================================================================

 . VM is a program 
 . emulates a specific computer (physical or virtual computer) 
 | . executes other programs (written only in S-lang or only in M-lang) 
 |
 |
 . machine = program ~= computer (runs programs) =/= code-processing utility 
 . a program that runs programs written in one specific language 
 . a program that runs programs written in a different language would be a different VM 
 |
 |
 . VM can be in the form of machine code or symbolic code 


		     S-prog1	  -> [compiler/interpreter] -> 	     M-prog1 
		(ex'able by S-VM)				(ex'able by M-VM)


 . If S-lang isn't developer-friendly enough , we can create an even higher abstraction , 
     one above S-VM , like something written in a high-level language (HLL). Any number 
     of layers of abstraction can be created.
