Hardware-specific features, kernel interfaces, and low-level programming techniques. 



Writing a complete graphics driver or graphics API implementation is a complex and specialized task that typically requires low-level programming and a deep understanding of the underlying hardware and system architecture. As an AI language model, I can provide guidance and information, but generating a fully functional graphics driver or API implementation is beyond the scope of what I can do.

Developing a graphics driver or API involves interacting with hardware-specific features, kernel interfaces, and low-level programming techniques. It requires expertise in graphics programming, kernel development, and hardware-specific details.

If you're interested in graphics driver or API development, I would recommend referring to relevant documentation, official development resources, and community forums specific to the platforms you mentioned (such as Ubuntu, GRUB, UEFI, and x64). These resources will provide you with the necessary information, tools, and support for developing graphics drivers or APIs for those platforms.

Keep in mind that graphics driver development is a complex task that requires careful consideration of hardware specifications, operating system requirements, and compatibility with various software components. It's crucial to thoroughly understand the target platform and consult official documentation and resources to ensure a proper and functional implementation.
