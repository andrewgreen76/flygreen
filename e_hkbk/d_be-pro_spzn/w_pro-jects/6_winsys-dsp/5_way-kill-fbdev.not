The primary replacement for fbdev (Linux framebuffer device) as a display system on Linux is the Wayland display protocol. Wayland is a modern and more advanced display protocol designed to overcome some limitations of the traditional X Window System and provide a more efficient and secure graphics stack.

Wayland provides a simpler and more direct communication between applications and the display server, allowing for better performance and smoother user experiences. It offers features such as compositing, input handling, and window management. Wayland aims to provide a more integrated and seamless graphical environment for Linux-based systems.

Many Linux desktop environments and window managers, including GNOME, KDE Plasma, and Sway, have transitioned or are in the process of transitioning from X Window System to Wayland as the default display system. Wayland is designed to take advantage of modern graphics technologies, such as hardware-accelerated rendering and buffer sharing, resulting in improved graphics performance and reduced latency.

However, it's important to note that the transition from X Window System to Wayland is still ongoing, and the level of support and compatibility may vary depending on the specific hardware, drivers, and applications. Some applications and legacy systems may still rely on X Window System or use compatibility layers like XWayland to run on Wayland.

In summary, Wayland has emerged as the primary replacement for fbdev as the display system on Linux, providing a more modern and efficient alternative with better integration, performance, and security.
