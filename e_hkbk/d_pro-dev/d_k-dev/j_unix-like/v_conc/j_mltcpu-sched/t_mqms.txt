Multi-Queue Multiprocessor Scheduling (MQMS) - scalability :
 |
 |
 + every CPU gets its own queue - NO NEED FOR SYNCHRONIZATION
 |
 + every CPU gets around to its next task sooner - CORE PERFORMANCE BOOST
 |
 + every CPU gets :
    . a pre-core scheduler (or all get a global scheduler) 
    . a completely independent queue 
    => completely independent concurrent scheduling and task assignment 
    => FASTER , WIDER THROUGHPUT - up to N tasks scheduled at a time -and- up to N tasks assigned at a time 
    => less of a need for load balancing (theoretically) 
    => reduced communication between cores (low-latency , but latency is latency)
