ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) primarily deals with low-level audio functionalities, including PCM (Pulse Code Modulation) audio for playback and recording. It is focused on handling digital audio data and providing audio output for applications. ALSA provides the infrastructure for applications to produce and consume audio data in various formats, including WAV, FLAC, MP3, etc., and it is not directly tied to MIDI sound playback.

To play back MIDI sounds on Linux, you typically need a MIDI sequencer and synthesizer. Two common tools used for this purpose are:

1. **Timidity++**: Timidity++ is a software synthesizer for MIDI and can be used to play MIDI files or provide a MIDI sound source for applications. It interprets MIDI data and generates audio output. You can install Timidity++ on many Linux distributions and use it as a command-line tool or configure it to work with MIDI-enabled applications.

   To install Timidity++ on Ubuntu, for example, you can use the following command:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install timidity
   ```

   After installation, you can play MIDI files using Timidity++ by running:
   ```bash
   timidity your-midi-file.mid
   ```

2. **FluidSynth**: FluidSynth is another software synthesizer that can be used to play MIDI files and provide MIDI sound. It's known for its high-quality sound fonts. Like Timidity++, FluidSynth can be used as a command-line tool or as a backend for applications that require MIDI playback.

   To install FluidSynth on Ubuntu, you can use the following command:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install fluidsynth
   ```

   To play a MIDI file using FluidSynth, you can run:
   ```bash
   fluidsynth -a alsa -m alsa_seq /path/to/soundfont.sf2 your-midi-file.mid
   ```

These tools provide the MIDI sequencing and sound synthesis capabilities needed to play back MIDI sounds on Linux. ALSA can be used alongside these tools to handle the audio output from the software synthesizers. MIDI applications often use ALSA's sequencer interface to communicate with MIDI devices and software synthesizers, allowing for MIDI input and output.

In summary, ALSA is primarily responsible for PCM audio playback and recording, while tools like Timidity++ and FluidSynth are used for MIDI sound playback on Linux.
