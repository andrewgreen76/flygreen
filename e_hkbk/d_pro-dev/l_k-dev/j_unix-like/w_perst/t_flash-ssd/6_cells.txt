CELLS IN FLASH STORAGE : 
============================================================================

 . a flash-chip transistor can store multiple binary values
 . {0,1} is mapped to the charge trapped


 . single-level cells (SLC) : 
    . store one bit
    . fast and expensive 
 . multi-level cells (MLC) :
    . the intensity of the charge represents two bits

      	  low      - 00
	  mid-low  - 01
	  mid-high - 10
	  high	   - 11

 . triple-level cells (TLC) :
    . three bits per cell 

 . quad-level cells (TLC) :
    . four bits per cell
