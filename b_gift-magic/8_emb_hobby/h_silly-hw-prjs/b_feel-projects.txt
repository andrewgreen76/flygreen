Going back and forth between :
 . hardware :
    . gamecon board
    . FPGAs 
 . programming : 
    . own dumb linker
      (a) in C to make elf for x86-64
      (b) in C to make .ino.hex , .ino.elf for AVR
      (c) in C to make ?? for PIC
    . own interpreter 
 . own fringe stuff :
    . own dumb architecture 


The expectation - but not at all a requirement - of all students is that they : 
 . develop their own game
 . study ISAs (and ideally develop their own ISA) 
 . FW ONION : examine / write their own BIOS / embedded system (Embedded Linux/Free RTOS) 
 . CC ONION : write their own C compiler 
 . write their own language and the compiler/interpreter for it
 . OS ONION : write their own operating system
    . write their own hardware driver(s) - I/O (disk, peris, (NIC)) , graphics , audio , etc. 
 . HW ONION : develop a piece of hardware to study hardware
 . AS ONION : write your own assembler
 . LD ONION : write your own linker (with or without listening to linker scripts) 


(a) Follow courses
(b) Teach yourself
