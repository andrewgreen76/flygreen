Translation Lookaside Buffer :
. a hardware cache
. stores more frequently used virtual-to-physical address translations
. built into the MMU
. "Virtual memory would not be possible without the performance improvement afforded by TLBs."
. 32-64 entries in a single TLB 
|
Reminder : 
. accessing a cache is quicker than accessing a page table



TLB entry :
"
    20 bits: Virtual Page Number (VPN)
    6 bits: Process ID (PID); sometimes called Address Space ID or ASID
    6 bits: unused
    20 bits: Page Frame Number (PFN)
    N bit ("Not Present" bit) : If set, memory access bypasses the cache
      . meaning there's no translation for this virtual address
      . a page table lookup will have to be done 
    D bit: Dirty bit - If set, memory is writeable 
    V bit: Valid bit - indicates whether the entry has a valid translation or not
    G bit: Global bit - If set, TLB does NOT check PID for translation 
"


How a TLB is used :
. the kernel obtains the VPN and translates it to the PFN

Cache lines :
. contents of neighboring addresses in RAM can be easily moved into a cache line
. only fully-associative caches, such as the TLB, possess this property 

Four instructions to update a software-managed TLB :
. TLBP probes the TLB for a specific translation
. TLBR reads the contents of a TLB entry into registers
. TLBWI replaces a specific TLB entry, and
. TLBWR replaces a random TLB entry
