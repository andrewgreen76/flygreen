Remind me how to create a new branch of 'main' in Bash.



ChatGPT

To create a new branch named "new-branch" based on the current "main" branch in Bash, you can use the following Git command:

bash

git branch new-branch

This command creates a new branch called "new-branch" at the same commit as the current branch (in this case, "main").

To switch to the newly created branch, you can use the git checkout command:

bash

git checkout new-branch

Alternatively, you can combine the branch creation and switching steps into a single command using the -b flag:

bash

git checkout -b new-branch

This command creates a new branch called "new-branch" and switches to it in one step.
