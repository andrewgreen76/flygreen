In the mid-1990s, one of the most popular languages for implementing peer-to-peer (P2P) networks was C++. C++ was widely used for system-level programming and offered low-level control and performance necessary for networking and distributed systems.

During that time, P2P networking was gaining traction with the rise of file-sharing applications like Napster, Gnutella, and FastTrack (which powered the popular application Kazaa). These applications allowed users to share files directly with each other without relying on centralized servers.

C++ was favored for P2P network implementation due to its efficiency, control over memory management, and access to low-level networking APIs. It provided developers with the ability to write high-performance code, manipulate network protocols, and handle data transfers efficiently. Additionally, C++ had a rich set of libraries and frameworks that could be leveraged for P2P network development.

However, it's important to note that P2P network implementations could also be found in other languages during that time, depending on the specific project and development requirements. Languages like Java, Python, and Perl were also used for certain P2P applications and services, although C++ was particularly popular due to its performance and low-level capabilities.
