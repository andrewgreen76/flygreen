=== More advanced streaming commands/operators: ==================================================================

[cmd] > [file]		- streams command output to a file, overwriting it
[cmd] >> [file] 	- streams command output to a file, appending to it

[cmd_l] | [cmd_r]	- the pipe operator streams output from [command_l] as an argument to [command_r]
	  		- Does not work with
 			       [cmd] | echo	    and		[cmd] | cat
			  You need the command substitution method for that. (Scan through below.) 

[cmd] | tee [file]   	   - streams command output to the file and to the shell, overwriting the file
[cmd] | tee -a [file]	   - streams command output to the file and to the shell, appending to the file

[cmd] 2> [ermsg.txt] 	   - stderr : streams the error message(s) to a file.  
[cmd] &> [ermsg.txt]   	   - streams the error message(s) to the shell and to the file. 

cat "$([cmd])"		   - this COMMAND SUBSTITUTION streams command/composite output to the cat command.

... > /dev/null		   - going nowhere, getting deleted

cat [in_file] | ./[prog]   - inputs within a file as inputs for a program 
./[prog] < [in_file]	   - // -
