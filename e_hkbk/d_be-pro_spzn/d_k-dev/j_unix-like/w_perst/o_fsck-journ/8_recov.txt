FS STABILITY : 
==================================================================================================================

Stable state : 
 . a file system state where there is consistency between the bitmaps , inodes , and data blocks
 . must be regained/maintained before and after changes to FS (even if it means dropping the file changes) 



==================================================================================================================
FORMS OF RECOVERY : 
==================================================================================================================

When a crash or a power outage occurs in the middle of writing to FS , the FS is stuck in corrupt (inconsistent) state.



Ways to regain stability :
  |
 (a) roll back (revert) the changes to FS , achieving the initial stable state 
 (b) replay (re-enact) all the changes to FS , achieving the final stable state 
  |
  . We will need JOURNALING.
