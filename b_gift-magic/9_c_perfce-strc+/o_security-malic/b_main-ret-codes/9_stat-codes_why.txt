USE OF main() RETURN CODES

"
When a program exits, the kernel stores its return value (exit status) so that the parent process can later retrieve it using system calls like `wait()` or `waitpid()`.

What is the "return 0;" in int main() for?
ChatGPT

In the int main() function in C, the statement return 0; is used to indicate the successful termination of the program. The value 0 is typically returned to the operating system as the program's exit status, indicating that the program executed without any errors.

The int main() function serves as the entry point of a C program. It is where the program execution begins. When the main function reaches its end or encounters a return statement, the program terminates, and the control is handed back to the operating system.

By convention, returning 0 from main signifies successful execution of the program. It indicates that the program completed its tasks as expected and did not encounter any errors or exceptional conditions. Other non-zero return values can be used to indicate specific error conditions or to provide additional information about the program's execution.

For example, you might use a non-zero return value to indicate an error code when the program encounters a failure, such as a file not found, an invalid input, or an unexpected condition. The specific meaning of non-zero return values can be defined based on the requirements or conventions of the program or the system it is running on.

Overall, return 0; in int main() is a way to communicate the successful termination of the program to the operating system or any other calling code that invoked the program.
