A GUI API (Graphical User Interface Application Programming Interface) and a display server protocol serve different purposes in the context of graphical display and user interfaces. Here's an overview of the differences between them:

GUI API:
A GUI API refers to a set of software libraries, frameworks, or tools that provide a programming interface for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in applications. These APIs offer a collection of functions, classes, and methods that developers can use to create windows, widgets, controls, handle events, and perform other GUI-related tasks. GUI APIs provide abstractions and tools to simplify the development of graphical applications and facilitate user interaction.

Examples of GUI APIs include GTK (GIMP Toolkit), Qt, Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), JavaFX, and wxWidgets. These APIs are typically used by application developers to build the visual components and behavior of their software, such as buttons, menus, text fields, and application windows.

Display Server Protocol:
A display server protocol, on the other hand, is a communication protocol that governs how graphical display and input are managed and transmitted between the client applications and the display server. It defines the rules and mechanisms for rendering windows, handling input events, and managing the graphical output on a computer system.

The display server protocol is responsible for tasks such as window management, compositing, handling input events (e.g., mouse clicks, keyboard input), managing graphics buffers, and coordinating the interaction between client applications and the underlying hardware.

Examples of display server protocols include X11 (X Window System), Wayland, and Mir. These protocols provide the infrastructure for managing graphical display, interacting with input devices, and coordinating the rendering of windows and graphics on a computer system.

In summary, while a GUI API provides a programming interface for building graphical user interfaces within applications, a display server protocol defines the rules and mechanisms for managing graphical display and input communication between client applications and the display server. The GUI API is used by developers to create the visual components and behavior of their applications, while the display server protocol handles the underlying system-level tasks of rendering, input handling, and window management.
