/*Note that inline Assembly is platform-specific and not part of the standard C++ language. The syntax and available instructions may differ between compilers and architectures. It's also worth mentioning that using inline Assembly should be done sparingly and with caution, as it can make the code less portable and harder to maintain.*/
