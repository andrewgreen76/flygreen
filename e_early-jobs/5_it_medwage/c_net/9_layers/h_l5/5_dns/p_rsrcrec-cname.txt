===================================================================================
RESOURCE RECORD TYPE: CNAME
===================================================================================

 . resolves one domain to another (more widely accepted) domain 

	[this.com] ---> [www.this.com]
	[www.this.com] ---> [IP address]


This is great because this way the IP address, when it has to change, will change only in one place - the CNAME
  record on the authoritative name server's end.
