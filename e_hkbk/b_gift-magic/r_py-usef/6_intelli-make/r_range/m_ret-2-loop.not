The `range()` function in Python generates a sequence of numbers within a specified range. It is commonly used in loops and iterations to control the number of iterations or to create an iterable sequence.

The basic syntax of the `range()` function is as follows:

```python
range(start, stop, step)
```

The function takes up to three arguments:

- `start` (optional): The starting value of the range (inclusive). If not specified, the range starts from 0.
- `stop` (required): The ending value of the range (exclusive). It specifies the upper limit of the sequence. The range will generate numbers up to, but not including, this value.
- `step` (optional): The increment between consecutive numbers in the sequence. It determines the spacing between the generated numbers. If not specified, the default step value is 1.

Here are a few examples to illustrate the usage of the `range()` function:

```python
# Example 1: Generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to 9
for num in range(10):
    print(num)

# Example 2: Generate a sequence of even numbers from 2 to 10
for num in range(2, 11, 2):
    print(num)

# Example 3: Generate a sequence of numbers in reverse order
for num in range(10, 0, -1):
    print(num)
```

In these examples, the `range()` function is used to generate sequences of numbers that are then utilized in `for` loops. The first example generates numbers from 0 to 9, the second example generates even numbers from 2 to 10, and the third example generates numbers in reverse order from 10 to 1.
