LCD DISPLAYS IN GENERAL 
===================================================================================

 . An LCD display has part-liquid , part-solid LC - liquid crystal (molecules).
 . passive (non-emissive) displays - i.e. , require backlighting 


TN (twisted nematic) displays :
 . earliest LCD technology
 . initially , LC molecules are aligned horizontally on a medium in the first polarizer layer , letting all
     "parallel" waves from the backlight pass
 . there is a layer of specifically shaped electrodes , each one with the shape of its assigned segment 
 . once voltage , if dictated by display logic , is applied to a segment/electrode in the second polarizer
     layer , the crystal molecules in that layer will be aligned vertically and block the incoming light waves
 . in use for professional purposes 
 + cheap , easy to manufacture , better response times (avoiding motion blur) , easy to make for any size / shape
 + fast refresh rates <= instant render of detail of any single frame in real time 
 - narrow viewing angles , color distortion (violating our intentions/desires given our knowledge of the color
     theory) , poor contrast (pixels losing hue at a really wide viewing angle) 


IPS (in-plane switching) displays :
 . LC are situated horizontally to the screen
 + great color fidelity to what the engineers were aiming for
 + wider viewing angles
 - expensive
 - low refresh rates
 - slow response times
    . "For IPS displays, slow response times mean pixels take longer to change colors, which can cause motion
       blur or ghosting in fast-moving images." 


VA (Vertical Alignment) :
 . LC are vertically aligned
 . good performance for general-purpose applications
 + great contast
 - slow response times
