# Experimental edutainment/tutorial repository "Fly Green"

__________________________________________________________________________
The PURPOSE of this repo:
__________________________________________________________________________

To help individuals, with or without a technical background, to: 
- improve their productivity in general (combatting ADD, figuring out
  alternatives to unhealthy solutions, etc.) 
- (especially for beginners)
  - hone their programming skills,
  - internalize key programming and engineering concepts,
  - learn about different systems,
  - understand and build a perspective on modern computing through studying
    its history. 

__________________________________________________________________________
The MANIFESTO is:
__________________________________________________________________________

> to run
  - to use for practical or artistic reasons
> to share
  - to show off
> to study
  - to learn
> to modify
  - to hack ethically and creatively

__________________________________________________________________________
Topics and methods explored to an extent over the past 24-48 hours:
__________________________________________________________________________

- Bash :
  - more commands,
  - argument and variable management in scripts, 
- daemons in general / outside of systemd
  - (not specifically in the context of networking)
  - importance 
  - no daemons in Apple II 
- systemd , systemd init
  - unwieldy structure
  - unit files
  - system services / daemons 
- GitHub troubleshoot :
  - git log 
  - git checkout [commit-hash] -- path
  - (need to cover ground with Git branches)

CHOSEN PROFESSIONAL PROJECT:
__________________________________________________________________________

- maintaining [the Linux kernel] >>>or<<< systemd
- An API / display server protocol for a 13h-like mode portable to any headless system. 
__________________________________________________________________________
CHOSEN PERSONAL PROJECT:
__________________________________________________________________________

- a virtual machine,
- an emulator,
- or a video game that poses as an operating system (a la Last Call BBS).
  - Can I use the Unity Engine for that?
  - research dedicated toolchains. 
- challenge: faithful resolution
- plan of attack:
  - fide: 320x200
  - now: 1920x1200, 6 times both ways.
  - consider fair, authentic scaling. 
- learn BIOS-kernel-API/DSP-distro ladder for that
