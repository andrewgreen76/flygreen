We want something that is ...
 . fast + maybe capacious (i.e., efficient)
 . reliable (robust)

===========================================================================================
RAID - REDUNDANT ARRAY OF INDEPENDENT DISKS 
===========================================================================================

 . idea for reliability - storing the same data on multiple disks
 . thought of as one disk ("logical disk") 
 . used in servers and data centers

===========================================================================================
TRANSPARENCY 
===========================================================================================

Leveraging not one , but all disks as though they are one big (logical) disk.

 . The functionality is no different from that of a single physical disk.
 + Portability : nothing else needs to change if a physical replacement occurs.
 => makes RAID deployable (i.e., user-friendly , hassle-free)
