DOSBox is an open-source emulator program that allows users to run software designed for the DOS operating system on modern operating systems like Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. It was developed using a variety of libraries, APIs, and programs. Here are some of the key ones:

    SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) - SDL is a cross-platform development library that provides low-level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D.

    Allegro - Allegro is a software library that simplifies the process of developing cross-platform computer games and multimedia applications.

    Freetype - Freetype is a software library that provides support for rendering high-quality, scalable fonts in computer graphics.

    OpenGL - OpenGL is a graphics API (Application Programming Interface) that provides developers with a standard way to create 3D graphics in a variety of programming languages.

    zlib - zlib is a software library used for data compression.

    NASM (Netwide Assembler) - NASM is an assembler and disassembler for the x86 architecture that is widely used in the development of operating systems and other low-level programming.

    GDB (GNU Debugger) - GDB is a debugging tool used to analyze and troubleshoot code during the software development process.

These are just some of the key libraries, APIs, and programs used in the development of DOSBox. There may be others as well, depending on the specific version of DOSBox and the platform it is being developed for.
