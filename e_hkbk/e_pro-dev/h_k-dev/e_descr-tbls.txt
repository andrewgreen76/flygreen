DESCRIPTOR TABLES 
========================================================================================

Interrupt descriptor table : 
 . data structure 
 . accessed by OS
 . we target hardware-related subroutines 
 . holds addresses/entry points of interrupt handlers/subroutines
 . given an ISR int number -> entry point for this ISR


Segment descriptor table : 
 . a.k.a. global descriptor table (GDT) 
 . data structure
 . accessed by a process 
 . exclusive to protected mode
 . we target process segments
 | 
 . every CS in GDT is defined with the following attributes :
   . access rights (rwx perms) 
   . base
   . size ("limit")
   . type of segment (code , data , system) 

 
File descriptor table : 
 . data structure
 . accessed by OS
 . we target open files (that are used by a process)
 . file descriptors = int vals mapped to individual file objects (w/ file status ,
     location , access perms) 


As you can see , these three things belong to conversations on very different topics
  as they serve different purposes. Nevertheless , they are all data structures with 
  mappings.
