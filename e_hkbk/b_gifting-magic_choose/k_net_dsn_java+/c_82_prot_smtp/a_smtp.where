SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is a fundamental protocol used for sending and routing email messages across networks. It is utilized by a wide range of organizations and entities that require email communication. While there isn't an exhaustive list of organizations that exclusively use SMTP, here are some examples of entities that commonly rely on SMTP for their email services:

    Internet Service Providers (ISPs): ISPs play a crucial role in providing email services to their customers. SMTP is a key component of their email infrastructure, allowing users to send outgoing email messages through their ISPs' SMTP servers.

    Businesses and Enterprises: Virtually all businesses and enterprises rely on SMTP for their email communication. SMTP servers are configured within their infrastructure to handle outgoing email delivery, enabling employees to send emails to recipients within and outside the organization.

    Email Service Providers (ESPs): ESPs are companies that offer email marketing and delivery services. They utilize SMTP to send large volumes of emails on behalf of their clients, such as newsletters, promotional emails, and transactional messages.

    Web Hosting Providers: Web hosting providers often include email hosting services as part of their offerings. They utilize SMTP to enable their customers to send and receive email messages using their domain names.

    Government Organizations: Government entities at various levels, including local, regional, and national, rely on SMTP for their email communication. SMTP is used for sending official communications, interdepartmental correspondence, and citizen engagement.

    Educational Institutions: Schools, colleges, and universities typically use SMTP for their internal and external email communication. SMTP facilitates email delivery among students, faculty, staff, and administration, as well as communication with external entities.

    Non-profit Organizations: Non-profit organizations, including charities, foundations, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), utilize SMTP for their email communication needs. It enables them to reach their members, donors, and partners through email correspondence.

It's worth noting that while organizations may utilize SMTP for sending outgoing email, they often employ other protocols such as POP3 or IMAP for receiving and retrieving email messages. The combination of SMTP, POP3, and IMAP forms a comprehensive email ecosystem.
