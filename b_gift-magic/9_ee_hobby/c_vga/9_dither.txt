VGA achieves more than eight colors through a technique called color dithering or palette swapping. Here's how it works:

1. **Palette**: VGA hardware typically uses a palette of 256 colors. Each color in this palette is represented by a unique combination of red, green, and blue (RGB) intensity levels.
  
2. **Color Registers**: VGA has color registers where you can specify the index of the color in the palette to be used for specific purposes, such as background color, text color, etc.

3. **Color Dithering**: By quickly alternating between nearby colors in the palette, VGA can simulate additional colors that are not directly represented in the palette. This is achieved by rapidly switching between two or more colors in adjacent palette entries. When viewed from a distance or at a lower resolution, the human eye perceives these rapid color changes as a blended color.

4. **Color Mixing**: Additionally, VGA can mix the colors from adjacent palette entries to create new colors. By adjusting the intensities of the red, green, and blue channels, VGA can produce a wide range of intermediate colors that are not explicitly defined in the palette.

Overall, through these techniques, VGA hardware can effectively display more than eight colors by exploiting the limitations of human perception and the capabilities of the RGB color model.
