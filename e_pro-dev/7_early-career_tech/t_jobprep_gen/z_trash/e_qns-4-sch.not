I wish to enroll for an online program for MS in Computer Engineering with a focus on operating systems, the Linux kernel development, and GPU/device driver development. 

- Do you have a program relevant enough to be close to the focus? 
- What are the actual deadlines for (a) the admission and (b) the enrollment in courses for Fall 2024 (unlike what it says on your website)?
- Can I enroll in summer classes?
- What is the actual current cost per credit-hour for an out-of-state part-time student and full-student? If it's beyond my budget, can the whole enrollment plan go as far as five years ? 
- Do I get to select which class to take or is it something that will be decided on by an academic advisor?
