Lots of agency recruiters reach out to companies that are hiring to say “hey, we can help you fill this position”. For example if a recruiting agency just placed ten software engineers and they see your company is hiring a software engineer the recruiter or account executive from the recruiting agency may reach out saying “I see you’d like to hire a software engineer, we know lots of good ones!”. Companies put “no recruiters” in their job ads because they want to minimize this noise. They may have an agency they’re working with or they may have determined it’s not worth it to pay the recruiting agency fee, which is normally 20–30% of a person’s first year salary.
