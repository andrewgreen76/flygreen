In the examples I provided, the use of `const` in member functions serves to indicate that these functions do not modify the object's state. The `const` specifier is part of a feature known as "const correctness" in C++, and it helps enforce the idea of immutability or non-modifiability in certain contexts.

Here's a brief explanation of the usage of `const` in C++:

1. **Member Functions Marked as `const`:**
   - When a member function is marked with `const`, it means that the function promises not to modify the state of the object it is called on. This allows the function to be called on constant or read-only objects.

    ```cpp
    class MyClass {
    public:
        int getData() const {
            // This function does not modify the object's state
            // ...
            return data;
        }

    private:
        int data;
    };
    ```

2. **Const Objects:**
   - When an object is declared as `const`, it means that the object's state cannot be modified through that reference or pointer. Marking member functions as `const` enables them to be called on `const` objects.

    ```cpp
    const MyClass obj;
    int value = obj.getData();  // Calling a const member function on a const object
    ```

3. **Preventing Unintentional Modifications:**
   - Marking member functions as `const` also helps prevent unintentional modifications of the object's state within those functions. If you attempt to modify a non-mutable member variable inside a `const` member function, the compiler will generate an error.

   - It contributes to making your code more robust and self-documenting, as it clarifies the intended behavior of the function.

Using `const` in these contexts helps make your code safer, more readable, and more maintainable by enforcing a clear distinction between functions that modify the object's state and those that do not. It's a good practice to use `const` wherever applicable to indicate and enforce immutability where desired.
