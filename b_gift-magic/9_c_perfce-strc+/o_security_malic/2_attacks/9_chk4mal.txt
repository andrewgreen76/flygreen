MALWARE DETECTION, EXAMINATION, AND REMOVAL
===================================================================================

If you have a reason to believe that a computer may be infected, gather info from the user.
 |
 . date the symptoms
 . date and examine the download history
 |
 . check for the symptoms
 |  . it's slow
 |    <= takes up too much memory
 |    <= any other reason
 |  . restarts on its own
 |
 . use the machine's resource manager to monitor the processes
    . observe processes with any funny names, inquire the user about the program
    . observe memory usage


If you have a reason to believe that it is now a part of a botnet:
 . quarantine it ASAP
    . disconnect the device from WiFi
    . unplug the Ethernet cable
    . disable automatic backup - seeing that the device can get infected again if the malware is backed up
 . do an offline malware scan
 . reconnect for a moment, see whether the anti-malware software / threat definition files updated automatically
 . finish the scan
 . confirm that there are no more issues
 . re-enable automatic machine backup
 . create a safe restore point
 . educate the user on safe practices
