Speedtest.net, the popular internet speed testing service, was started in 2006. It was developed by Ookla, a company specializing in network diagnostics and broadband testing tools.

Speedtest.net allows users to test their internet connection speed by measuring the download and upload speeds, as well as ping (latency) to a designated server. The service quickly gained popularity and became one of the go-to tools for users to assess their internet performance.

Over the years, Speedtest.net has expanded its services and offerings. In addition to the website version, Ookla has developed mobile apps for iOS and Android, allowing users to perform speed tests on their smartphones and tablets.

The accuracy, reliability, and ease of use of Speedtest.net have contributed to its widespread usage by individuals, internet service providers (ISPs), and various organizations to benchmark and monitor internet performance.

It's worth noting that since the start of Speedtest.net, Ookla has introduced additional products and services, such as enterprise solutions for ISPs and network operators, as well as other diagnostic tools to analyze network performance.
