Proof by induction : 
 . PROVE THE BASE CASE 
 . PROVE THE generic/INDUCTIVE CASE 
 . You get a formula ? (Arithmetic series formula.) 
 . ex. : sum of first n positive integers
    . 0 is not a positive integer 
    . n=1 => n(n+1)/2 => 1         = 1 = sum of first n=1 positive integers - 1 
    . n=2 => n(n+1)/2 => 3         = 3 = sum of first n=2 positive integers - 1+2
    . n=3 => n(n+1)/2 => 3(2)      = 6 = sum of first n=3 positive integers - 1+2+3
