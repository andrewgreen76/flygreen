Fast File System (FFS)

 . addressed the causes of poor performance - fragmentation and handling large blocks 
 . first FFS was developed for BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution)
 . File systems evolve. The inteface and compatibility factors remain the same , but the implementation is optimized for performance and reliability.
 . There are hundreds of FS out there , many still rooted in FFS :
   . ext2 (Linux)
   . ext3 (Linux)
   
 + inodes are structured in an array
 + the array is immovable
   => it's easy to zero in on an inode prior to reading/writing
