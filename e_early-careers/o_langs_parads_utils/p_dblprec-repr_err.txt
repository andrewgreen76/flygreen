===================================================================================
THE NATURE OF THE FLOATING-POINT REPRESENTATION ERROR :
===================================================================================

"
The specific limit of 17 digits in double-precision floating-point numbers arises because the IEEE-754 standard allocates [52] bits for the significand, which can accurately represent approximately 16 to 17 decimal digits.
"



"
The IEEE-754 double-precision format follows the "round to nearest, ties to even" rule, where numbers are rounded to the nearest representable value, and in cases of a tie, the value is rounded to the nearest even digit.
