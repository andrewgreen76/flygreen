In the C language, why are we taught to use '%d' for integers while '%i' also works the same?

The %i and %d format specifiers are not the same.

True, they behave identically when used with the *printf functions. But for *scanf, the %i format specifier will parse integer literals just like the compiler.

For example read “010” using %d, and you'll get a value of 10. But %i will return a value of 8, since the leading zero indicates an octal constant. Similarly, read “0x10” using %d, and you'll get 0 (integer parsing will stop on the “x”) but %i will return 16.

The %i format specifier is supported by *printf mainly for reasons of symmetry.
