To make the time uptake of each iteration of a routine more consistent, you can reduce variability by minimizing resource contention through techniques like setting real-time process priority with sched_setscheduler(), disabling CPU frequency scaling, running on a dedicated core with task affinity (taskset), and avoiding I/O or memory-intensive background processes, though perfect consistency is challenging due to inherent system dynamics.
