The ANSI escape code for yellow (\033[33m for foreground or \033[43m for background) may appear as a golden brown shade in some terminal emulators due to their default color schemes or display calibration, which can vary the perceived hue.
One-Sentence Solution:
To achieve a brighter or more "true" yellow, try using the 256-color ANSI escape code \033[38;5;226m for foreground or \033[48;5;226m for background, which specifies a vivid yellow in terminals supporting 256 colors.
Example C Code:
c

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("\033[38;5;226mThis is a brighter yellow text!\033[0m\n"); // 256-color foreground
    printf("\033[48;5;226mThis has a brighter yellow background!\033[0m\n"); // 256-color background
    return 0;
}

Notes:

    Why Golden Brown?: The standard 8-color yellow (\033[33m or \033[43m) might look golden brown if your terminal's color palette is configured with muted or warm tones, or due to monitor settings.
    256-Color Mode: The code \033[38;5;226m (foreground) or \033[48;5;226m (background) selects a vivid yellow from the 256-color palette, which is closer to a "true" yellow. Check if your terminal (e.g., GNOME Terminal, xterm) supports 256 colors by running echo $TERM (should show xterm-256color or similar).
    True Color: For even more precision, true-color ANSI codes (e.g., \033[38;2;255;255;0m for RGB yellow) can be used in terminals like Windows Terminal or modern Linux terminals, but support varies.
    Testing: If the 256-color code still doesn't look right, your terminal's color theme or monitor calibration might be affecting the output. Try changing the terminal's color scheme or testing in another emulator.

If you want a specific shade or help with your terminal's settings, please share your terminal type (e.g., GNOME Terminal, Windows Terminal) or desired yellow shade!
