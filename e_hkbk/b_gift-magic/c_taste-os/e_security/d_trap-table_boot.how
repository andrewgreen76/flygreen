@ boot time :
. the machine creates the trap tables, and every table is at own location 
. the machine switches to kernel mode
. configures the hardware
. Nothing else should take place.
. Preventive/protective measures :
  . TRAP HANDLERS :
    . Special instructions are executed for the kernel to share trap tables (with trap handlers) with the hardware.
  . EXECUTE CODE :
    . When an unexpected event (I/O, keyboard event, syscall) takes place,
      the kernel's trap tables/handlers tell the hardware what code to run.
  . OS tells the hardware where to locate the trap handlers and then what code to execute.
  . "OS needs to raise exceptions when a process tries to perform an illegal operation (privileged instruction, out of bounds memory, etc.)."
  . REGISTER EXCEPTION HANDLERS : 
    . OS tells the hardware knows what code to run and where to find it in the event of a raised exception
