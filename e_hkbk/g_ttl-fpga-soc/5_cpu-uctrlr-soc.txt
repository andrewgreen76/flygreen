Q : CPU vs. microcontroller. 

A : "a microcontroller integrates a CPU, memory, and peripherals into a single chip, while a CPU
     typically requires external components like RAM and I/O devices to function."
    | 
    "... the key distinction is that a microcontroller typically targets simpler, low-power, embedded
     applications with a limited set of features, while an SoC is designed for more complex applications,
     often including advanced peripherals like GPUs, networking, or multimedia processing capabilities."



Q : SoC vs. microcontroller.

A : "... an SoC (System on Chip) integrates a CPU, memory, peripherals, and often additional components
     like graphics or networking, all on a single chip, while a microcontroller typically focuses on
     simpler tasks with a smaller set of integrated components, often used for embedded systems."
