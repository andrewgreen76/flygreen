Mux and Dmux in comm networks :
- information can be sent in a serial line of 0's and 1's from the Mux at the source to the Dmux at the destination.
  The sel at each of those components is connected to a clocking device called the oscillator. The oscillator keeps feeding an alternating pattern of
  0's and 1's so that the digital data keeps getting driven bit by bit.
