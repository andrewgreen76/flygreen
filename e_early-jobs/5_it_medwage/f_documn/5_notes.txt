ALWAYS DOCUMENT YOUR WORK
 |
 . sidenote : the necessity to document definitely applies to embedded engineering
 . this is why we have TICKETS / TICKETING SYSTEMS - for documenting issues in IT - not emails
 |
 . "Bug tracking with only emails isnâ€™t scalable because issues become hard to organize, prioritize, search,
      and track across multiple users and projects."
 . "For something to **not be scalable** means it CANNOT HANDLE INCREASING WORKLOAD, growth, or demand
      efficiently without breaking down or requiring disproportionate resources."
