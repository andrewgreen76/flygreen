Can you recommend me a toolchain for making a very basic, dumb application for the GNOME environment?

If you're looking to develop a basic application for the GNOME environment, you can use the following toolchain:

    Programming Language: GNOME applications are commonly developed using the C programming language. You can use the GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) to compile your C code.

    Development Libraries: GNOME provides a set of libraries and frameworks for building applications. The primary library is GTK (GIMP Toolkit), which is used for creating graphical user interfaces. You can install the necessary development packages for GTK using the package manager of your Linux distribution.

    Build System: To manage the build process, you can use the Meson build system along with the Ninja build tool. Meson simplifies the build configuration and generates the necessary build files, while Ninja performs the actual build process. These tools provide a streamlined and efficient way to compile your application.

    Integrated Development Environment (IDE): While not necessary, an IDE can greatly enhance your development workflow. GNOME Builder is a popular IDE specifically designed for GNOME application development. It offers features like code editing, project management, debugging, and integration with the GNOME development tools.

Additionally, it's helpful to refer to the GNOME Developer Documentation and tutorials available on the GNOME project website. They provide detailed information on getting started, application design, and best practices for GNOME development.

By using this toolchain, you can create basic GNOME applications and gradually add more features and complexity as needed.
