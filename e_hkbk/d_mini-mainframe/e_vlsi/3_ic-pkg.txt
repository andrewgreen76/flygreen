The packages used in making ICs (integrated circuits) for a laptop motherboard can vary depending on the specific components and their functionalities. Common packages for ICs found on laptop motherboards include:

1. **Ball Grid Array (BGA):** This is one of the most common package types used in modern laptop motherboards. BGA packages have solder balls arranged in a grid on the underside of the chip, which are directly soldered to pads on the motherboard. They provide good electrical performance and compact size, making them suitable for densely packed circuit boards like those found in laptops.

2. **Quad Flat Package (QFP):** While less common in modern laptops, QFP packages were widely used in earlier generations of laptop motherboards. QFPs have leads on all four sides of the package, which are soldered to the surface of the motherboard. They offer relatively easy soldering and are suitable for components with moderate pin counts.

3. **Small Outline Integrated Circuit (SOIC):** SOIC packages are also less common in modern laptops but may still be used for certain components. SOIC packages have leads on two sides of the package and are suitable for components with lower pin counts compared to QFPs.

4. **Thin Small Outline Package (TSOP):** TSOP packages are used for memory chips and other components requiring a low-profile design. They have leads on two sides of the package and are commonly used for memory modules in laptops.

In summary, while QFP and SOIC packages were more common in older laptop motherboards, modern laptops predominantly use BGA packages due to their compact size, high pin density, and suitability for surface mounting on densely packed circuit boards.
