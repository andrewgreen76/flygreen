 + You will be using GCC to create your own [Whatever_]compiler ("WCC").
 . The GCC compiler's input files will be source files with names that must
     end with ".c". You can develop your own compiler using GCC to take in
     files with ".any_file_extension". 


 - We will NOT be starting with minimal assembly to push towards a brand-spanking-new 
     flavor of C. 
 - We will NOT be implementing C system calls from scratch.
