Monolithic kernel :
 . the kernel's drivers and core modules - SCI , process scheduler , and memory manager - work together
     in kernel space
 + efficient communication between the kernel's parts 
 - No mutual protection : if not handled correctly , these parts can make an impact on one another and
     therefore crash the entire operating system , so implement the kernel carefully. 


Microkernel :
 + the memory manager and device drivers are separate processes moved to userspace
    => they can't crash the system 
 + efficient memory utility by user processes
 + leaner kernel 
 . direct access to hardware (makes it easy to play around with peripherals)
 - abuse of memory and hardware by user processes
