DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is not inherently bidirectional in the sense that it doesn't involve continuous bidirectional communication between a client and a server once the initial configuration is completed. Instead, DHCP primarily operates in a unidirectional manner during the lease negotiation process.

Here's how DHCP works in terms of directionality:

1. **Client Request (Unidirectional)**: When a device (the DHCP client) connects to a network, it typically doesn't have an assigned IP address. It sends a DHCPDISCOVER message (broadcast) to the local network, requesting an IP address and other network configuration parameters.

2. **Server Response (Unidirectional)**: A DHCP server on the network receives the DHCPDISCOVER message. The server selects an available IP address and sends a DHCPOFFER message (unidirectional) to the client, offering the IP address and other configuration settings.

3. **Client Acceptance (Unidirectional)**: The client receives one or more DHCPOFFER messages from available DHCP servers and selects one. It then sends a DHCPREQUEST message (unidirectional) to the chosen server, requesting the offered configuration.

4. **Server Confirmation (Unidirectional)**: The DHCP server that receives the DHCPREQUEST message sends a DHCPACK message (unidirectional) to the client, confirming the lease and providing the configuration details. If the DHCP server cannot fulfill the request, it sends a DHCPNAK message (unidirectional) instead.

5. **Lease Duration (Unidirectional)**: Once the client has received a DHCPACK, it configures its network settings according to the provided parameters. The lease duration is also specified in the DHCPACK message, indicating how long the client can use the assigned IP address.

During the lease period, the client and server do not continuously exchange messages. The client retains the leased IP address until the lease expires or until it requests a renewal (which typically happens midway through the lease period) by sending a DHCPREQUEST to the server. The renewal process is again unidirectional in nature.

So, while the initial DHCP lease negotiation involves bidirectional communication for a short period, the ongoing use of the leased IP address does not involve continuous bidirectional communication between the client and the DHCP server. Instead, it operates primarily in a unidirectional manner.
