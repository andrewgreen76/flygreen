Yes, you can add or rewrite a line in the middle of a file using commands like `echo`, `awk`, or `sed` in combination with file redirection.

Here's an example using `sed` to replace a line at a specific line number in a file:

```bash
sed -i '3s/.*/new line/' file.txt
```

This command replaces the contents of line 3 in `file.txt` with "new line". The `-i` option is used to edit the file in-place.

Similarly, you can use `awk` to replace a line at a specific line number:

```bash
awk -v line=3 'NR==line {$0 = "new line"} 1' file.txt > temp.txt && mv temp.txt file.txt
```

In this command, `line=3` sets the line number to be replaced, and `$0 = "new line"` assigns the new line content. The resulting output is redirected to a temporary file `temp.txt`, which is then moved back to replace the original file.

To add a line at a specific line number, you can combine `sed` or `awk` with the `echo` command and file redirection. Here's an example using `sed` to insert a new line at line 3:

```bash
echo "new line" | sed '3i\' file.txt > temp.txt && mv temp.txt file.txt
```

This command pipes the new line content to `sed` with the `3i\` command, which inserts the line before line 3. The output is redirected to `temp.txt` and then moved back to replace the original file.

Note that when modifying files with these commands, it's always a good practice to create backups or test on a sample file to avoid accidental data loss.
