Can you give me one small example of a format string vulnerability?

Certainly! Format string vulnerabilities occur when a program accepts user input as part of a format string argument without proper validation or sanitization. This can lead to security vulnerabilities, including information leaks or arbitrary code execution.

Here's a small example that demonstrates a format string vulnerability:

c

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char username[20];
    printf("Enter your username: ");
    scanf("%s", username);

    printf("Welcome, ");
    printf(username); // Vulnerable line
    printf("!\n");

    return 0;
}

In this code snippet, the program prompts the user to enter their username. However, instead of using a format specifier like %s to properly handle the user input, it directly passes the username string to the printf() function.

If an attacker enters a format string containing format specifiers, such as %x or %n, it can lead to unintended behavior. For example, an attacker could use %x to leak memory contents or %n to overwrite a memory address with a value representing the number of characters written so far.

To fix the vulnerability, it is important to properly handle user input and ensure that format string arguments are used correctly. In this case, using %s as the format specifier in the printf() function would prevent the format string vulnerability:

c

printf("%s", username); // Safe usage

By using the correct format specifier, the program will interpret the username string as a regular string without parsing any format specifiers contained within it.

It's crucial to validate and sanitize user input before using it in format string arguments to prevent format string vulnerabilities and ensure the security and stability of the program.
