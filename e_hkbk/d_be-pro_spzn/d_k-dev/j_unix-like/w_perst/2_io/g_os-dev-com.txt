METHODS FOR KERNEL-DISK COMMUNICATION 
==========================================================================

1) the kernel uses I/O INSTRUCTIONS to directly work with the disk
   . the kernel receives a request from the user-space 
   -> it formulates an I/O request based on the user request
   -> it uses the device driver (disk driver) 

   . instructions are provided by device drivers
   . device drivers are built into the kernel 
 
2) kernel leverages CANONICAL DEVICES to work with disks , etc.  
   . OS and devices exchange data via mmap'd addresses in the interface
   . this eliminates the need for I/O instructions
