JOURNALING : 
==================================================================================================================

 . a.k.a. write-ahead logging
 . alternative to the slow `fsck`


1) keeping record in `struct journal` :
   |  . kept between a superblock and a block group somewhere in the middle of the disk
   |  + intended file ops
   |  + metadata
   |  + data
   |
   |
2) recovery using the journal
   |  . fixing the targets in the process 
   | (a) initial state of FS is regained
   | (b) final state of FS is achieved
