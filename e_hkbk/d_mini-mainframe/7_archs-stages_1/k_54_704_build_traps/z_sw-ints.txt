The very first use of software interrupts can be traced back to the IBM 704 computer, which was introduced in 1954. The IBM 704 had a form of interrupt mechanism that allowed for software interrupts, enabling the execution of a specific piece of code in response to certain conditions or events. This feature marked the beginning of interrupt-driven programming in computing.
