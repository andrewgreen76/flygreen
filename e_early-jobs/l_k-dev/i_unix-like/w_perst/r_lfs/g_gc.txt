Live block :
 . most recently formed copy of a data block

CLEANING - HANDLING OLD COPIES : 
===================================================================================

LFS cleaner
 . akin to a garbage collector 


 + LFS cleaner periodically reads the oldest copy from the disk into a buffering segment
 . LFS cleaner figures out which blocks are live
 . moves only the live blocks back onto the disk 
   

 - formation of free holes on the disk 
 + holes can be filled 
    + a buffering segment can help with this
