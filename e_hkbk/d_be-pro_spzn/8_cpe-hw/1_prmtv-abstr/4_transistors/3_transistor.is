1) A transistor serves two purposes :
   - allows for a simple control of current ("go"/"do not go")
   - allows for regulation of how much current can flow between the collector and the emitter 

2) A transistor is a hardware component that can receive, store, and release one electrical charge at a time. 
- Two inputs : collector (or source) and the base.
