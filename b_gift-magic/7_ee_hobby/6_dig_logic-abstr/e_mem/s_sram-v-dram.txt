SRAM :
. every memory cell (for a single bit) is made up of GATES
+ fast memory access
+ does not rely on a constant data (really, 0/1 charge) refresh 
- costly

DRAM :
. every memory cell is made up of A TRANSISTOR AND A CAPACITOR
+ cheap
- relies on the constant data/charge refresh
- slow memory access
