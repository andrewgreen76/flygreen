What was the port number for the SNA mainframe?
ChatGPT

The Systems Network Architecture (SNA) is a proprietary networking architecture developed by IBM for their mainframe computers. SNA does not use specific port numbers in the same way as modern network protocols like TCP/IP.

Instead of port numbers, SNA uses a different mechanism called "Logical Unit (LU)" to identify and communicate with different components within the SNA network. An LU is a logical entity that represents a specific device, application, or service within the SNA environment.

Each LU is assigned a unique identifier called the "LU name" or "LU alias," which is used to address and communicate with the specific entity. Communication between LUs within an SNA network is facilitated through session establishment and message exchange, where the LUs exchange data and commands based on the SNA protocol stack.

It's important to note that SNA is a complex and extensive networking architecture that encompasses various protocols, services, and components. While port numbers are not used in the same manner as in TCP/IP-based protocols, SNA has its own mechanisms for addressing and routing data within the network.
