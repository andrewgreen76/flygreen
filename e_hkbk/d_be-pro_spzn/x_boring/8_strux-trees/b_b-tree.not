Self-balancing like red-black trees , but ...
|
. allows 2+ children per parent
=> height can be less than in a red-black tree due to the branching factor (num of children)
=> can help reduce amount of I/O work (num of disk operations - less than O(logn) ) 
=> used in databases and file systems : 
   . efficient maintenance of large amounts of data 
   . efficient performance I/O operations
   . massive amounts of data pooled from databases may not fit the RAM
     => may be stored on the disk
      . O(logn) work on the B-tree may be done in RAM 
|
|
. like a k-d tree : allows for more than one item per node
. size of a B-tree node ~= size of a disk page
