TTL vs. CMOS
========================================================================================


TTL :
 |
 . transistor-transistor logic
 |
 - great power consumption (some consumption even at rest)
 - very responsive to energy (electrical/thermal) noise
 + does not require much power to drive internal logic
 |
 . BJTs
 . source and drain
 . LS - Low-power Schottky


CMOS :
 |
 . complimentary metal-oxide semiconductor
 |
 + easier to make on substrates 
 + moderate power consumption (no consumption at rest)
 + high resistance to noise and input signal 
 - requires one more volt to drive internal logic
 |
 . (MOS)FETs
 . collector and emitter
 . HC - High-speed CMOS
 . Cxxxx - belongs to a CMOS family (may not be high-speed)
