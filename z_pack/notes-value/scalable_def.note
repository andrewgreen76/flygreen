When something is highly scalable, it means that it can handle a growing amount of work, data, or users without compromising its performance or functionality. A highly scalable system can accommodate a significant increase in demand or workload without requiring a significant increase in resources or causing any significant performance degradation.

Scalability is an essential feature for many businesses and applications because it allows them to grow and expand without facing limitations in their operations. A highly scalable system can handle more customers, more transactions, or more data without experiencing any slowdowns, downtime, or crashes.

Scalability can be achieved through various techniques, such as distributed computing, load balancing, caching, and vertical or horizontal scaling. A highly scalable system is usually flexible and can adapt to changes in demand or workload, making it more efficient and cost-effective in the long run.
