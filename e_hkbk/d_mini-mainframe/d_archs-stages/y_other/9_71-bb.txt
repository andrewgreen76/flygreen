BEFORE BREADBOARDS : 
========================================================================================

"
Before the widespread use of breadboards, circuits were prototyped using several methods, including:

1. **Wire Wrapping**: Components were connected by wrapping wires around their terminals, often using a special wire-wrapping tool. This method provided secure and easily modifiable connections.

2. **Soldering on Perfboard or Stripboard**: Components were soldered onto perforated boards (perfboards) or stripboards (Veroboards), where the holes were laid out in a grid, and conductive strips provided connections between components.

3. **Point-to-Point Wiring**: Components were directly connected to each other by soldering wires or leads between their terminals, often mounted on wooden or plastic boards.

4. **Vectorboards**: Similar to perfboards, these boards had a grid of holes with no predefined connections, allowing for custom wiring using solder or wire wrapping.

These methods allowed engineers and hobbyists to create and test electronic circuits before committing to a more permanent design on a printed circuit board (PCB).

DEVELOPMENT OF BREADBOARDS :

Breadboards, as used in electronics for prototyping and testing circuits, were invented in the 1970s. The modern plastic, solderless breadboard was developed by Ronald J. Portugal, who filed a patent for it in 1971.
