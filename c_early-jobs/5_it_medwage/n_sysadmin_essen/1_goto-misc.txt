A computer is working very slowly:
 . CPU and RAM gouging
 . use Windows/Linux utilities to examine what the processes are up to resource-wise


An error or a crash has occurred:
 . root issue vs. cascading error
 . searching for the word “error” in a log
 . searching for the name of the application running into error
 . get information on the time when an error or a crash took place
 . When having a filtered list of errors for relevant info, work your way from the top or from the bottom.
 . Working from the top may help resolve the root issue.
 . Working from the bottom might help zero in on the actual issue.
 . You can also troubleshoot the issue in real time, having the ill-ridden application already fired up and
     monitoring activities in a log.


Hard reboot:
 . a.k.a. hard restart
 . "a forced reboot of a device by cutting power and then turning it back on"
 . "typically by holding the power button until it shuts down completely"
