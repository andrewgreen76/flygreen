Please give me an example of a simple CLI-only website I can access just for a test-drive.

Sure! Here's an example of a simple CLI-only website you can access using the curl command:

arduino

curl http://wttr.in

This website provides weather information based on your location. When you run the above command, it will return the current weather conditions for your location in the command line.

You can also provide a location as an argument to the command to get weather information for a specific location. For example, to get weather information for New York City, you can run:

arduino

curl http://wttr.in/New+York

This will return the weather information for New York City in the command line.

Note that wttr.in is a third-party website, and we do not endorse or guarantee its accuracy or reliability. It is provided here solely as an example of a simple CLI-only website that you can access using the curl command.
