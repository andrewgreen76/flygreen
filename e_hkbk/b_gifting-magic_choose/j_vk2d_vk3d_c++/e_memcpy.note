What role does the function memcpy() play in the code above?
ChatGPT

The function memcpy() in the code above is used to copy the pixel color value to the memory that is mapped to the buffer.

The memcpy() function is used to copy a block of memory from a source address to a destination address. In this case, the pixel color value (0xFFFFFFFF) is copied to the memory mapped to the buffer using memcpy(). The size of the block of memory to be copied is specified by the fourth parameter of vkMapMemory() function call, which is bufferCreateInfo.size, and is set to 4 bytes. This is because the pixel color value is a 32-bit unsigned integer and takes up 4 bytes of memory.

Once the buffer is filled with the pixel color value, the buffer can be used as the source of a transfer operation to copy the pixel color value to the image. The transfer operation is typically performed using the vkCmdCopyBufferToImage() function.
