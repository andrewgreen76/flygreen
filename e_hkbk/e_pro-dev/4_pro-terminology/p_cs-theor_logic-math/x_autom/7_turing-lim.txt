Alan Turing :
 . Turing's work was mostly concerned with the theoretical
 . definition of calculability/computability/solvability
 . explored the limits of computability by any machine

TURING'S THEORIES : 
=============================================================================

(Universal) Turing Machine (TM) :
 |
 |
 . a machine that can compute anything
 |
 . key stipulations : 
 |  . able to perform conditional branching
 |  . HAS AN ARBITRARILY LARGE AMOUNT OF MEMORY (an infinitely long tape) 
 |
 => not possible in practice
 . in the real, physical world machines can be near-TM (memory can't be infinite) 
 |
 . has a TABLE with INSTRUCTIONS to follow :
    | 
    . conditions
       . old state (dimns/params) 
    . actions 
       . new state
       . reading , writing , etc.
