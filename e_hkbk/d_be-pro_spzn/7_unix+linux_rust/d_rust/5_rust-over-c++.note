What isnâ€™t taken care of in C++ that is taken care of in Rust?

Rust addresses several areas where C++ falls short, providing features and guarantees that improve safety, memory management, and concurrency. Here are some aspects where Rust provides stronger guarantees compared to C++:

    Memory Safety: Rust's ownership and borrowing system ensures memory safety at compile time. It eliminates common memory-related bugs like null pointer dereferences, use-after-free, and data races by enforcing strict rules for ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes. C++ does not have the same level of compile-time memory safety guarantees and relies more on manual memory management, making it more susceptible to memory-related errors.

    Data Races: Rust provides static guarantees of thread safety through its ownership and borrowing model. The borrow checker ensures that multiple mutable references to a piece of data cannot exist simultaneously, preventing data races. In C++, thread safety is left to manual synchronization using locks, atomic types, or higher-level concurrency abstractions, which requires careful coding and can be error-prone.

    Null Pointers: In C++, null pointers can lead to undefined behavior when dereferenced. Rust's type system distinguishes between nullable and non-nullable references, and it enforces null safety by requiring explicit handling of potentially null values using the Option type. This approach reduces the likelihood of null pointer errors and associated crashes or security vulnerabilities.

    Undefined Behavior: Rust aims to eliminate undefined behavior, which can have unpredictable consequences in C++. Rust's compiler enforces strict rules to prevent undefined behavior, such as bounds checking for arrays and preventing buffer overflows or underflows. C++ allows more flexibility and manual memory manipulation, making it easier to introduce undefined behavior if not used with care.

    Concurrency: Rust provides built-in support for safe concurrency. The ownership and borrowing system, along with Rust's concurrency primitives and traits like Send and Sync, ensure thread safety and prevent data races. C++ provides concurrency support through libraries like the Standard Template Library (STL) and the C++11 threading library, but it requires more manual synchronization and offers fewer compile-time guarantees.

    Build System and Dependency Management: Rust has a built-in package manager and build system called Cargo, which simplifies managing dependencies, building, and testing Rust projects. Cargo ensures consistent and reproducible builds, handles dependency resolution, and provides a standardized project structure. While C++ has build systems like CMake and dependency managers like Conan, the ecosystem is more fragmented and lacks a standardized solution.

It's important to note that while Rust provides stronger guarantees in these areas, C++ still offers greater flexibility and a larger ecosystem of libraries and frameworks. The choice between Rust and C++ depends on the specific requirements of the project and the trade-offs that need to be considered.
