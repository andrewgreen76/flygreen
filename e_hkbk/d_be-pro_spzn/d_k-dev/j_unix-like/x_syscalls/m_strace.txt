"
`strace` is a diagnostic tool in Unix-like operating systems that is used to trace and display the system calls made by a program during its execution. System calls are low-level operations performed by a program to interact with the kernel, such as file I/O, network communication, and process management.

The `strace` command is particularly useful for debugging and understanding the behavior of a program. By tracing system calls, you can observe how a program interacts with the underlying operating system, which can be helpful for identifying issues, understanding performance bottlenecks, or diagnosing unexpected behavior.

Here's a basic usage example:

```bash
strace command [arguments]
```

Replace "command" with the name of the program you want to trace and provide any necessary arguments. When you run this command, `strace` will print a detailed log of the system calls made by the specified program.

For example:

```bash
strace ls -l
```

This will trace the `ls` command and display the system calls it makes.

Keep in mind that `strace` provides a lot of information, and the output can be extensive. It's often used in conjunction with other tools for more effective debugging and analysis. Additionally, some systems might require you to install `strace` using the package manager specific to your distribution.
