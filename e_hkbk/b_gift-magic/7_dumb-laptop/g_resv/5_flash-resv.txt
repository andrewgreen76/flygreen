One example of a tiny storage device featuring SPI flash memory is the "Adafruit SPI Flash SD Card - XTSD" module. This module is compact, approximately the size of a thumb, and integrates both SPI flash memory and an SD card slot. It's commonly used in microcontroller projects and embedded systems where compact storage solutions are required, and it communicates with the host device over SPI interface for data transfer and storage.
