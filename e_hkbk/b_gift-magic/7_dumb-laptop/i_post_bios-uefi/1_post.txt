HARDWARE INITIALIZATION :

 . "Configuring the components entails setting up parameters and initial states necessary
    for proper functionality, including allocating memory addresses, establishing communication
    protocols, and calibrating device settings."

 . "Parameters include specifications such as memory timings, interrupt priorities,
    communication protocols, and device addresses essential for the correct operation and
    interaction of hardware components within the computer system."

POST (Power-On Self-Test) typically precedes the execution of BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) during the boot process of a computer.

When you turn on a computer, the first thing it does is execute the POST routine. POST is a series of diagnostic tests performed by the computer's firmware to check the hardware components such as the CPU, memory, storage devices, and peripheral devices to ensure they are functioning correctly. 

Once the POST process completes and the hardware is determined to be operational, the BIOS is then executed. The BIOS initializes essential system hardware, performs system checks, and loads the operating system from the storage device (such as a hard drive or SSD) into memory for execution.

So, in summary, the sequence is typically: POST first, followed by the execution of BIOS.
