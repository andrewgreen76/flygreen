Hereâ€™s a simple C program that waits for a single keypress and then reacts by printing a message:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <conio.h> // For getch() on Windows

int main() {
    char ch;

    printf("Press any key to continue...\n");
    ch = getch(); // Wait for a single keypress

    printf("You pressed: '%c'\n", ch);
    return 0;
}
```

Note: The `conio.h` header is specific to some compilers like Turbo C or those on Windows. For Unix-like systems, you would need to use different methods (like using `termios` for non-canonical mode). Let me know if you need an example for a different platform!
