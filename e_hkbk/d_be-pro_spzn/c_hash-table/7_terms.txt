TERMINOLOGY : 
========================================================================================

 . KEY : the input to be converted to a number 
 . HASHING : conversion of the key to some number (before you can track the needed info) 
 . HASH CODE (or HASH VALUE) : the number the key is hashed to 
 . HASHING ALGORITHM : used to perform the conversion
    . There is no one hashing algorithm. There are different flavors out there.
 . BUCKET : a SLOT in the hash table's array
 . COLLISION : two or more keys are hashed to the same hash code (and, ergo, the same bucket) 
 . KEY-VALUE PAIR : the data struct the hash table is made up of.
    . the hash table starts off with an array of key-value pairs
    . if there is a collision at a bucket , the new pair is either added (if registering)
      or denied (if searching) 
    . VALUE : the piece of information you are after from the lookup
