What isn't taken care of in C that is taken care of in C++ in terms of security and otherwise?

C++ is an extension of the C programming language and provides several features and mechanisms that help improve security and provide higher-level abstractions compared to C. Some of the key areas where C++ offers additional functionality and security features compared to C include:

    Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): C++ supports object-oriented programming paradigms such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. These features enable better code organization, data hiding, and modularity, leading to more secure and maintainable code.

    Stronger type checking: C++ provides stronger type checking compared to C. It includes features like user-defined types, classes, and constructors, which can enforce type safety and reduce the risk of type-related vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows or memory access errors.

    Standard Template Library (STL): C++ includes the STL, which provides generic algorithms and containers like vectors, lists, and maps. The STL offers type-safe and efficient data structures, reducing the chances of errors and vulnerabilities associated with manual memory management and data manipulation.

    Exception handling: C++ supports exception handling, allowing programmers to catch and handle exceptional conditions during runtime. This mechanism helps prevent program crashes and provides a structured approach to handling errors, improving security and reliability.

    Resource management: C++ provides the concept of constructors and destructors, which allows for automatic resource management. Through the use of smart pointers, RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) idiom, and containers like std::vector and std::string, C++ helps automate resource allocation and deallocation, reducing the risk of resource leaks and memory errors.

    Standard libraries: C++ includes a rich set of standard libraries that provide functionality for various tasks, such as string manipulation, input/output operations, cryptography, networking, and more. These libraries often have built-in security measures and are continuously maintained and updated to address security vulnerabilities.

    Standardization and safer features: C++ is a standardized language, and its standardization process focuses on safety, security, and portability. Newer versions of the C++ standard introduce safer features and idioms, such as range-based loops, nullptr, smart pointers, and constexpr, which help improve code correctness and reduce vulnerabilities.

While C++ offers these additional features and security improvements over C, it's important to note that writing secure code ultimately depends on the programmer's knowledge, practices, and adherence to secure coding guidelines. C++ provides tools and abstractions to help programmers write secure code, but it does not guarantee security by default.
