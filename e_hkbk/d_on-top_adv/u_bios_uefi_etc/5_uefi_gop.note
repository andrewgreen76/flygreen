How does UEFI GOP access the graphics driver?
ChatGPT

The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) Graphics Output Protocol (GOP) provides a standard way for UEFI firmware to interact with the graphics hardware during the pre-boot process. When the system is powered on, the UEFI firmware uses the GOP to initialize the graphics hardware and provide a basic graphics output interface.

To access the graphics driver through the UEFI GOP, the firmware must first identify and initialize the graphics hardware. This involves discovering the hardware resources and capabilities, setting the display mode and resolution, and configuring the necessary memory and I/O resources.

Once the graphics hardware is initialized, the UEFI GOP provides a set of standard services that the firmware can use to access the graphics driver. These services include functions for setting the display mode, drawing graphics primitives, and handling user input.

The UEFI GOP uses a simple graphics abstraction layer that allows the firmware to interact with the graphics hardware in a platform-independent manner. This means that the same UEFI GOP code can be used on different platforms with different graphics hardware, as long as the hardware supports the necessary UEFI specifications.

Overall, the UEFI GOP provides a standardized and efficient way for UEFI firmware to access the graphics driver during the pre-boot process, enabling features such as graphical boot screens, system configuration menus, and diagnostic tools.
