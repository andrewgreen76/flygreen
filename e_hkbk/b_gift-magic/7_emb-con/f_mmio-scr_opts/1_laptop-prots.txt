The transfer of pixel data from the framebuffer to the LCD panel typically doesn't occur directly through either the FPC (Flexible Printed Circuit) or the I2C bus. Instead, it happens through a different mechanism.

In most modern systems, including laptops, the transfer of pixel data from the framebuffer to the LCD panel is typically facilitated by specialized display interfaces such as LVDS (Low Voltage Differential Signaling), eDP (Embedded DisplayPort), or MIPI DSI (Mobile Industry Processor Interface Display Serial Interface). These interfaces are designed specifically for high-speed data transmission between the graphics controller (which accesses the framebuffer) and the LCD panel.

Here's how it generally works:

1. **Framebuffer to Display Controller**:
   - Pixel data stored in the framebuffer (often in system memory or dedicated graphics memory) is read by the graphics controller (GPU or integrated graphics) as required to update the display content.

2. **Display Interface**:
   - The graphics controller sends the pixel data to a specialized display interface controller.
   - This controller formats the pixel data according to the protocol used by the display panel (e.g., LVDS, eDP, MIPI DSI).

3. **FPC Connection**:
   - The formatted pixel data is then sent through the FPC (Flexible Printed Circuit), which physically connects the display interface controller to the LCD panel.
   - The FPC carries the pixel data along with other control signals necessary for the operation of the LCD panel, such as synchronization signals.

4. **LCD Panel**:
   - The pixel data received via the FPC is processed by the LCD panel's controller circuitry.
   - The LCD panel uses this data to control the individual pixels and display the corresponding image on the screen.

So, while the FPC is involved in the physical connection between the display interface controller and the LCD panel, and while the I2C bus may be involved in other communication aspects (such as DDC for EDID data), the transfer of pixel data itself typically occurs through dedicated display interfaces rather than the FPC or I2C bus.
