PROGRAM IMAGE : 
========================================================================================

 . a.k.a. executable image 
 . a.k.a. binary image
 . basically , a program in a state (binary) that allows it to be run (and does not need
   any further processing) 

"
A program image refers to a binary file that contains a compiled or executable version of
a software program, typically representing its machine code instructions and data in a format
ready for execution on a computer system.
"

"
The first CPU (Central Processing Unit) to be able to run a program image was the Manchester Baby,
also known as the Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM), developed at the University of Manchester
in England.

SSEM (THE MANCHESTER BABY) : 
========================================================================================

 . a.k.a. Small-Scale Experimental Machine

"
The Manchester Baby, also called the Small-Scale Experimental Machine, was the first electronic stored-program computer. It was built at the University of Manchester by Frederic C. Williams, Tom Kilburn, and Geoff Tootill, and ran its first program on 21 June 1948.
"

"
The first stored program run on the Manchester Baby (SSEM) was a program written by Freddie Williams and Tom Kilburn, who led the team that built the machine. The program demonstrated the operation of the SSEM by performing a simple calculation, specifically determining the highest proper factor of a given number (2^18 = 262,144). This program effectively showcased the capabilities of the SSEM as the world's first stored-program computer.

EARLY PROGRAM IMAGES - MEDIA , SYSTEMS , AND APPLICATIONS : 
========================================================================================

 . media :        paper tape , magnetic tape , punch cards
 . languages :    assembly language , machine code
 . tools :        assembler , etc.
 . applications : industrial , scientific , early microcomputer systems

WHERE THERE'S AN OS , THERE'S STORAGE 
========================================================================================

"
The Manchester Baby was capable of storing programs and data in the form of electrically charged mercury delay lines. These delay lines served as the primary form of memory for the machine, allowing it to store and retrieve data for processing. While the storage technology used by the Manchester Baby was primitive compared to modern storage devices, it represented a significant advancement in the field of computing and laid the foundation for the development of more sophisticated storage technologies in the years to come.
