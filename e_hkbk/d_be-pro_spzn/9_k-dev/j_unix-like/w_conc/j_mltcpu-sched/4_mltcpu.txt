A challenge : boosting the performance of a single CPU without significant power consumption.
 |
 + multiprocessors became the answer 
 + "Multiprocessor architectures are now common across various computing devices."
 - Simply adding more CPUs will not automatically boost the performance of a C program.
    . a C program typically runs on a single CPU 
 + But there are APIs that can help us achieve parallelism explicitly , thereby helping the program's performance. 
    . parallel processing ( fork() )
    . multi-threading ( <pthread.h> )
 - Also means that the higher code that leverages this may have to be rewritten. (Not what refactoring is.)
