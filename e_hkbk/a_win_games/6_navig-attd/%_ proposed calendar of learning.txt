   just one discipline. Life is long, but it's also finite. Which leads us 
   to ...

2. Negotiate the use of your time wisely. Think about what is worth 
   learning at the moment or in the future. The question is: What is really
   worth learning. Which brings us to ... 

3. Learn what you want. There is no sense in learning something you won't 
   find yourself engaged in. Otherwise, you won't be able to retain what 
   is being served to you, and that's not real learning. Cramming makes 
   less sense than going down the rabbithole of curiosity. 
   The rabbithole is always better, especially if it concerns current 
   systems and hardware. 
   
4. Figure out a calendar of things you are planning on learning today, 
   and then within the next few days, one week, four weeks, 3-6 months, 
   one year, 3-5 years, and so on. See point #1. Now let's see when you 
   exit that loop! :D
