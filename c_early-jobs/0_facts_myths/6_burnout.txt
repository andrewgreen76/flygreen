Yes, frustration and burnout are distinct, though related: frustration is a reaction to being blocked from a goal (feeling stuck), while burnout is chronic, pervasive exhaustion from prolonged stress, leading to detachment, apathy, and feeling ineffective, often encompassing frustration but as a deeper, systemic condition. Frustration can be a symptom or trigger of burnout, but you can feel frustrated without being burned out, and burnout involves a deeper loss of meaning and energy.
