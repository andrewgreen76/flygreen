NTP stands for Network Time Protocol. It is a networking protocol used for clock synchronization between computer systems over a network. The primary purpose of NTP is to ensure that all devices on a network have accurate and synchronized time, even if they are located in different time zones or have varying degrees of clock drift.

NTP operates in a client-server architecture, where one or more NTP servers provide time information, and client devices synchronize their clocks with these servers. The NTP clients regularly query the NTP servers to get the correct time and adjust their local clocks accordingly.

NTP is widely used in computer networks, especially in large-scale environments like data centers, financial institutions, and other critical systems where accurate timekeeping is essential. Accurate time synchronization is crucial for various purposes, such as log timestamping, security measures (e.g., certificate validation), distributed applications, and coordination between different devices and systems.

By keeping all devices in a network synchronized to a common time reference, NTP helps prevent issues related to skewed time, improves security, and ensures smoother operation and communication between networked devices.
