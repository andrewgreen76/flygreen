Yes, there are Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs) simpler than the MOS 6502. Some of these simpler ISAs include:

1. **Intel 8051**: The Intel 8051 is an 8-bit microcontroller with a simple and compact instruction set. It has a small number of instructions and a single accumulator-based architecture, making it relatively straightforward to program.

2. **PIC (Peripheral Interface Controller)**: PIC microcontrollers, developed by Microchip Technology (formerly General Instrument), feature a simple and efficient architecture designed for embedded applications. PIC instruction sets are generally smaller and less complex compared to some other architectures.

3. **Atmel AVR**: The AVR architecture, commonly found in microcontrollers such as the Arduino, is known for its simplicity and ease of use. It features a reduced instruction set computing (RISC) architecture with a relatively small number of instructions.

4. **Zilog Z80**: While the Z80 is more complex than some of the other examples listed here, it is still considered relatively simple compared to modern architectures. It is an 8-bit microprocessor with a straightforward instruction set and has been widely used in various applications, including home computers and embedded systems.

5. **Motorola 6800**: The Motorola 6800 is an 8-bit microprocessor known for its simplicity and ease of programming. It features a relatively small instruction set and straightforward addressing modes.

These are just a few examples of ISAs that are simpler than the MOS 6502. Each of these architectures has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of ISA depends on factors such as application requirements, performance needs, and development constraints.
