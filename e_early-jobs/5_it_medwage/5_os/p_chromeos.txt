CHROME OS 
===================================================================================

The goal is to demonstrate the power of web browsing as an alternative to dependence on the local hard drive.
 . working with emails
 . working with files like documents , images , etc.
 . connecting to another computer
 . casual gaming

The way a Chromebook works :
 . runs two things concurrently - the Chrome OS and (typically up to) one container called "Crostini"
 . the container hosts Android and other Linux-based distro applications

Benefits :
 + greater disk space - courtesy of the servers 
 + hard to penetrate , private data stays private ... even if the machine is stolen 
   <= no one can get admin rights
   <= features an AUTOMATIC FAILSAFE that restores the system to the latest secure snapshot 

Drawbacks : 
 - dependent on the EXTERNAL SERVERS within the **CHROME (CLOUD) INFRASTRUCTURE** 
 => this is definitely problematic for users who find themselves frequently unable to access WiFi
 - definitely not ideal for resource-intensive gaming
