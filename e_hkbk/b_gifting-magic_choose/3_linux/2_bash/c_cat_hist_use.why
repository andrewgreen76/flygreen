Why is the "cat" command called concatenation?

The "cat" command in Unix-like operating systems stands for "concatenate." While the name "cat" might seem misleading, it comes from the original purpose of the command, which is to concatenate and display the contents of files.

The primary use of the "cat" command is to read one or more files and display their content as a single continuous stream. By default, when you provide multiple file names as arguments to the "cat" command, it reads the files sequentially and outputs their contents in the order specified.

However, over time, the "cat" command has been used for various purposes beyond concatenation. It can be used to display the content of a single file, create new files, append to existing files, or even combine files in more complex ways using input and output redirection.

Despite its name, the "cat" command has evolved to become a versatile tool in Unix-like systems, and its usage extends beyond simple concatenation of files.
