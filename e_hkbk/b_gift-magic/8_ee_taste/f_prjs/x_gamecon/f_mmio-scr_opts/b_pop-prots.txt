In recent years, there has been a shift towards using eDP (Embedded DisplayPort) and MIPI DSI (Mobile Industry Processor Interface Display Serial Interface) for connecting LCD panels in laptops, particularly in newer models. While LVDS (Low Voltage Differential Signaling) used to be more common in older laptops, it has become less prevalent in newer designs due to its limitations compared to eDP and MIPI DSI. 

Here's a brief comparison of each:

1. **LVDS (Low Voltage Differential Signaling)**:
   - LVDS has been a standard interface for transmitting video data from graphics controllers to LCD panels for many years.
   - It uses differential signaling to achieve high-speed data transmission with low power consumption.
   - LVDS typically requires a larger number of pins and more complex cabling compared to newer interfaces like eDP and MIPI DSI.
   - While LVDS was common in older laptops, it has been gradually phased out in favor of more advanced interfaces.

2. **eDP (Embedded DisplayPort)**:
   - eDP is an interface standard developed by VESA (Video Electronics Standards Association) specifically for embedded displays in laptops, tablets, and other portable devices.
   - It is based on the DisplayPort standard but optimized for use in embedded systems with lower power consumption and reduced EMI (Electromagnetic Interference).
   - eDP offers higher bandwidth, greater flexibility, and fewer pins compared to LVDS, making it more suitable for modern laptop designs with thinner form factors and higher resolution displays.
   - Many newer laptops utilize eDP for connecting the LCD panel to the graphics controller.

3. **MIPI DSI (Mobile Industry Processor Interface Display Serial Interface)**:
   - MIPI DSI is a specialized interface standard developed by the MIPI Alliance for connecting mobile display panels to application processors in smartphones, tablets, and other handheld devices.
   - It is designed to meet the stringent power and bandwidth requirements of mobile devices while supporting high-resolution displays and advanced features such as touchscreens and camera interfaces.
   - MIPI DSI has gained popularity in laptops, especially in convertible or 2-in-1 designs that incorporate touchscreen functionality or require flexible display configurations.
   - Some laptops use MIPI DSI for connecting the main display panel, particularly in devices with touchscreens or advanced display features.

Overall, while LVDS may still be found in some older laptops, eDP and MIPI DSI have become more common in newer laptop designs due to their higher performance, lower power consumption, and greater flexibility, especially in meeting the demands of modern high-resolution displays and touch-enabled interfaces.
