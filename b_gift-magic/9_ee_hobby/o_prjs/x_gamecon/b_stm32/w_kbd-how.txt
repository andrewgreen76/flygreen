Yes, keyboards typically have a microcontroller that serves as the controller to manage and regulate the signal traffic between the keyboard and the computer or device to which it is connected. The microcontroller in a keyboard plays a crucial role in handling key presses, debouncing signals, and sending the appropriate data to the host system.

Here's a brief overview of how keyboards with microcontrollers work:

1. **Key Matrix and Switches:**
   - Keyboards use a key matrix arrangement where rows and columns of keys intersect. Each key has a switch, and pressing a key bridges a connection between a specific row and column.

2. **Switch Debouncing:**
   - When a key is pressed or released, the switch may produce multiple rapid electrical contacts due to mechanical bouncing. The microcontroller handles this by employing switch debouncing algorithms to ensure that only a single, stable keypress is registered.

3. **Matrix Scanning:**
   - The microcontroller continuously scans the rows and columns of the key matrix to detect any changes in the key states. It identifies which keys are pressed or released.

4. **Keycode Generation:**
   - Once a keypress is detected, the microcontroller generates a unique keycode corresponding to the pressed key. This keycode represents the specific key and is sent to the host system.

5. **Communication with Host System:**
   - The microcontroller communicates with the host system using a communication protocol such as USB (Universal Serial Bus) or PS/2. USB is more common in modern keyboards.

6. **USB HID (Human Interface Device) Protocol:**
   - Keyboards often follow the USB HID protocol for communication. The microcontroller formats the keypress information into HID reports and sends them to the host system, which interprets the reports and processes the keystrokes.

The microcontroller in a keyboard is a crucial component responsible for ensuring reliable and accurate input. It handles the complexities of scanning the key matrix, debouncing switches, and communicating with the host system. The specific microcontroller used in a keyboard can vary, and some keyboards may also have additional features or programmability depending on the design and intended use.
