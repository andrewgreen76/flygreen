PORT FORWARDING
===================================================================================

(1) . IP masquerading for dedicated individual servers of the same company

(2) . "Without port forwarding, company servers would be inaccessible from outside the local network because
       incoming requests couldnâ€™t reach the correct internal machines."
    => every server gets to work only with the dedicated system port
    . i.e., a mode in which certain nodes are configured to have inbound traffic arriving at a specific destination port
    
    . NAT will simply figure out which server to forward a packet to based on the incoming/outgoing system port for the packet. 
       . i.e., specific ports are used to forward specific kind of traffic to specific (server) nodes

    . A response packet from the server will leave the server at an ephemeral port (chosen by the server).
