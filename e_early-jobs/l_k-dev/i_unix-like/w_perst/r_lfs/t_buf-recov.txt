BUFFERING AND RECOVERY IN LFS : 
===================================================================================

Buffered transactions are written to the log on the disk when
 (a) the buffer write time inverval elapses
 (b) the buffer is full


Log anatomy :
 . head segment
 . tail segment
 . segments in the middle are linked with pointers


Crash recognition in LFS :
  . a CR at one end of disk 
  . a CR at the other end of disk
  . alternating atomic write to CRs
  . LFS uses new imap pointers 
     . a head segment with a timestamp
     . other info in the middle segments
     . a tail segment with the second and last timestamp
  . each CR is monitored :
     . the head and tail timestamps are compared
     . the CR with consistent timestamps is the more recent one 
     . the CR will be read for 
	. locating imap pieces
	. unread files
	. unread dirs
 -> roll forward :
     . a database approach 
     . info inside the CR will be used to reconstruct the FS to a stable state
