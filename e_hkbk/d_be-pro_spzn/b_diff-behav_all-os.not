- While processing something like

  	printf("How are you?");

  without the \n at the end of the prompt, different systems and different compilers will demonstrate different behavior. Some will print the prompt right on time and some won't.

- On some (Linux) systems in the gcc command you may have to include the tag for the library that is to be included in the source code, like 

     -lm

  or write out the absolute path to that .a/.so library.

  - However, you do NOT write out the tags for standard libraries (e.g., stdio, stdlib).
