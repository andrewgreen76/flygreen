Forward-biased diodes:
 . allowing current to flow easily in one direction
 . ex.: rectification, signal routing, LED lighting


Reverse-biased diodes:
 (a) blocking current
 (b) creating depletion regions for capacitance - varactors
 (c) detecting light - photodiodes
 (d) protecting circuits - flyback/Zener diodes


"
A reverse-biased diode is used instead of simply removing the connection because it dynamically blocks current in
  one direction while allowing the circuit to instantly switch to forward conduction when the voltage polarity
  reverses (e.g., in rectifiers, flyback protection, or logic gates), something an open circuit or physical switch
  cannot do automatically.
