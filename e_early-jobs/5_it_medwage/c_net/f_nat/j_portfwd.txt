PORT FORWARDING
===================================================================================

(1) . IP masquerading for dedicated individual servers of the same company 
    . every server gets to work only with the dedicated system port


(2) NAT will simply figure out which server to forward a packet to based on the incoming/outgoing system port for the packet. 
    . i.e., specific ports are used to forward specific kind of traffic to specific (server) nodes


 . a mode in which certain nodes are configured to have inbound traffic arriving at a specific destination port 
 . The server-bound packet leaves the gatewayâ€™s server-side networking interface on a system (or user) port.
 . A response packet from the server will leave the server at an ephemeral port (chosen by the server). 
 . IP masquerading for the server 
 . A system port can be chosen. 
 . A little different from port preservation. 
 . Same (destination) port.
