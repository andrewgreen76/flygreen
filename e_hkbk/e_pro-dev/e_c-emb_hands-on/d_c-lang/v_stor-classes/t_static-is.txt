========================================================================================

"
In C, the `static` keyword has several uses depending on its context:

1. **Static Variables**: When used inside a function, it makes a variable retain its value between function calls.
2. **Static Functions**: Restricts the scope of the function to the file where it is defined, making it inaccessible from other files.
3. **Static Global Variables**: Limits the scope of a global variable to the file where it is defined, preventing access from other files.
