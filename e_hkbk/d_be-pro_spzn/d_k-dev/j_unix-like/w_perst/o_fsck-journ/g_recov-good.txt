JOURNALING , ATOMIC TRANSACTIONS - SUCCESSFUL RECOVERY : 
============================================================================================

 . LOGGING : log intended write-ops into the journal

 -> CHECKPOINTING - tactics :
     . putting up key progress spots in the journal to help expedite potential replay  
     . snapshot (copy) of the target data blocks 

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 -> COMMITTING to the data blocks in FS ...
    ...
    ...
    [transaction marked as completed] -> [journal descriptor / commit block / transaction descriptor]
    [crash/outage]
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 -> RECOVERY - ANALYSIS :
     . FS will track completed write-ops

 -> RECOVERY - DECISION AND ACTION : 
     (a) finish line NOT reached => FS will roll back (revert) to the old state or last checkpoint -or- 
     (b) finish line reached 	 => FS will replay (re-enact) the logged operations and commit the changes 
      . depends on the design
      . depends on the stage to completion
      . depends on the transaction commit status 

============================================================================================
 . S-blocks must remain intact 
 . we are likely to have multiple transactions
