Parity :
 . the state of being even or odd
 . the parity of the sum of 1's in the data , not the parity of the data 

Parity bits :
 . used in detecting errors within data stored on RAID disks
 . parity bits accompany corresponding data
 . a fault-inspired erroneous change in one data bit changes the parity 
 . error checking : comparing pre-calculated parity bits with the newly calculated ones
 |
 . we are thinking a single erroneous change
   => if there is one error , we will catch it 

================================================================================
Odd parity arrangement :

 . (1's in data + [parity_bit] ) = odd number of 1's 

   1011001 1     =>	1 = parity bit 

   1101011 0     =>	0 = parity bit

================================================================================
Even parity arrangement :
  
 . (1's in data + [parity_bit] ) = even number of 1's 

   1101011 1     =>	1 = parity bit

   1110001 0 	 =>	0 = parity bit

================================================================================
Parity checks :
 . error-checking
 . fault tolerance
 . reconstruction after disk failure 

 . stored parity 	<- a bit representing even parity or odd parity 
 . calculated parity 	<- from the RAID controller or the host's CPU
    . if calculated parity bit does not match the stored parity bit , we have an error(s) 
 . single-bit parity fails with an even number of errors

Parity disk :
 . stores calculated parity bits to be matches with stored parity bits
