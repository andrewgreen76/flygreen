SOLID principles
Design patterns 
Does coreboot have prop pieces ? 

What open-source projects still use OpenGL ? 

I have a problem. I want to learn development of firmware, the kernel, graphics drivers, and graphics APIs for the x86/x64 architecture. I am honing my C, C++, and Python skills and I also want to learn Rust. I'm looking at potential projects to contribute to: Raspberry Pi, coreboot, Pop!_OS, the Linux kernel source tree

Find a place for (Open)AI in my superstack. (Python to build a dumb mini-AI.)  
statically typed - determined/accessible at compile-time
dynamically typed - accessible during runtime. 
objects :
- structs :
  - organization,
  - (using ptrs to build and manip. data structures - not to be confused with structs)
    - data structures retain node organization
    - data structures retain their own organization
    - data structures help us use memory economically (keep us away from memory bottlenecking) 
- (unions) 
ptrs :
- problems w/o ptrs:
  - tying objects together to make structures
- purpose:
  - dyn.memgmt,
  - distant recall
  - aliasing ("I hate having to write the long identifier for the same object")
