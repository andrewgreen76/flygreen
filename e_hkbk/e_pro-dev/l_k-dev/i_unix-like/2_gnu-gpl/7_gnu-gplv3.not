The GNU General Public License version 3 (GPLv3) was also authored by Richard Stallman and was published by the Free Software Foundation (FSF). The GPLv3 was released in 2007 as an updated version of the GNU GPL, incorporating new provisions and addressing emerging issues in the software industry. It aims to strengthen the copyleft principles of the GPL and address concerns related to software patents, digital rights management (DRM), and software as a service (SaaS). Richard Stallman and the FSF worked on the GPLv3 with input and feedback from the free software community to ensure that it reflected the values and needs of the community.
