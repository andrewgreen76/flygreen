Both Buildroot and the Yocto Project can be used to build customized Linux systems for embedded devices. However, it's important to note that "embedded" in this context refers to a wide range of devices and architectures, not limited to x86 or x64 machines.

While the primary focus of Buildroot and the Yocto Project is on building Linux systems for resource-constrained embedded devices, they can also be utilized for x86 and x64 architectures, depending on the specific requirements of the project.

Buildroot and the Yocto Project provide flexibility and customization options that can be leveraged to create Linux distributions for various target architectures, including x64 machines. They offer support for different hardware platforms, processor architectures, and toolchains.

In the case of x64 machines, the embedded Linux systems built with Buildroot or the Yocto Project can be tailored to specific needs, incorporating the necessary components, configurations, and software packages relevant to the target environment.

Therefore, while Buildroot and the Yocto Project are commonly associated with embedded systems, they can also be adapted for use with x86 and x64 machines, providing a means to create customized Linux distributions suitable for those architectures.
