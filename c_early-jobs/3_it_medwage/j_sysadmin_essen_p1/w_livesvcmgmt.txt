LIVE SYSTEM/SERVICE CARETAKING
===================================================================================

!!! NEVER TEST IN PRODUCTION !!!

Rollback:
 . reverting a piece of software or a system to its previous state
 . rolling back a command = undoing its action, the impact it made

Production:
 . a service is functioning live
 . production server - currently provides service
 . production service - a service currently being provided
 . an email service currently providing access to emails is an email production service

Test environment:
 . a VM
 . for testing any change you want to make, important or trivial, to a service
 . must be done BEFORE introducing it in a production service
 . even a small change might betray the integrity of the infrastructure

Secondary / stand-by machine:
 . a clone of an actual production service
 . same settings as the original
 . will not receive any actual traffic until we rule it otherwise
 |
 . apply the changes to the stand-by machine
 -> this machine is to be the primary machine
 -> apply the same changes to the original machine with production services

Canary:
 . an individual server meant for stress-testing (here, taking on a massive service workload)
 . for detecting issues arising from handling a massive workload
 . deployed as a group of canaries
