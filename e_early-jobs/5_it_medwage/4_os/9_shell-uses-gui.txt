SHELLS AND GUI 
===================================================================================

Shell :
 . "A shell is a user interface that allows INTERACTION WITH THE OPERATING SYSTEM’s services, either
    through a command line or graphical environment."
 . different shells have different features and handle performance differently
 . "In more advanced IT roles you might have to manage thousands of machines. You don't want to have to click
    a button or drag a window on every machine when you can just run a command once." 


Desktop environment :
 . "Providing the GUI for the desktop environment means supplying the visual interface elements (windows,
    icons, menus) that make up the desktop environment, but THE DESKTOP ENVIRONMENT ALSO INCLUDES BACKGROUND
    SERVICES AND INTEGRATION BEYOND JUST THE GUI."
 . GUI + processes


Shells that use a GUI :
| . Windows Explorer 
| . the GNOME shell
|
Shells that do not use a GUI :
| . PowerShell
| . z.sh
| . Bash
|
Whatever the case , A SHELL ALLOWS FOR INTERACTION WITH THE OS. 


Windows Explorer :
 . "Windows Explorer is a shell because it provides the graphical interface for FILE MANAGEMENT and the
    desktop environment, acting as the user’s primary interaction layer with the operating system."


The GNOME shell :
 . "The GNOME Shell is unique because it tightly integrates the window manager, application launcher, and
    system interface into a single unified environment."
