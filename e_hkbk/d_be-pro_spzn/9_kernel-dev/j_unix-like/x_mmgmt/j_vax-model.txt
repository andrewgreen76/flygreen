The DEC VAX-11 minicomputer and the VAX/VMS operating system.
_______________________________________________________________

"VAX/VMS was developed in the 1970s and a surprising number of techniques and approaches from this system have survived to this day."
. "A real address space is much more sophisticated than a simple user code, data, and heap address space ... ."



      VAX address space :

      . User process region P0
      	. page 0 (for detecting access to NULL by pointers ; inaccessible) 
      	. program code
	. data
	. the heap 
      . User process region P1
      	. the stack
      . there is a register for P0 and a register for P1 for switching between page tables of the same process
	
      . System space S
      	. the kernel virtual address space is a part of every user address space
      	. trap tables
	. kernel data (structures) 
	. kernel code
	. kernel heap
	. no stack
	. S also has its base and bound registers, but they are fixed
	  . all processes share the same system space
	  . the kernel can copy data via a process pointer to its own structures 
      . Unused space
