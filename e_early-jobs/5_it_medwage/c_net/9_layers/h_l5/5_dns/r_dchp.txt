Computerâ€™s TCP/IP networking requirements :
 . an IP address
 . the subnet mask (for the LAN)
 . a gateway (edge router) - mediates between networks 
 . a DNS server (process)
 |
 . xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/xx + a router + a DNS server 
 . all CONFIGURED = defined for the device -AND- can be changed at any time 
 . All nodes on the same LAN share the same {subnet mask, gateway, DNS server} , which can be achieved with easy automation.
 . Every node must be assigned its own unique IP address. How do you automate that? With DHCP. 
 |
 . Note : MAC addresses - hardcoded in firmware/software


Problem : assigning unique IP addresses to (numerous) newly connected nodes/hosts is a tedious task 


===================================================================================
DHCP (DYNAMIC HOST CONFIGURATION PROTOCOL) :
===================================================================================

 . an application layer protocol
 . Implementation : a DHCP server automatically assigns a unique IP address to the node newly connected to the
     TCP/IP LAN.
 . First, the DHCP server will reserve an IP address range for a group of client devices local to one another.
     That way they will belong to the same LAN. 
 . Dynamic IP address : an IP address assigned automatically to a device using the DHCP 


Servers and routers must have their IP addresses assigned and known
 . mainly for diagnostics among other reasons
 . this includes NTP (Network Time Protocol) servers
