__________________________________________________________________________
The PURPOSE of this repo:
__________________________________________________________________________

To help individuals, with or without a technical background, to: 
- improve their productivity in general (combatting ADD, figuring out
  alternatives to unhealthy solutions, etc.) 
- (especially for beginners)
  - hone their programming skills,
  - internalize key programming and engineering concepts,
  - learn about different systems,
  - understand and build a perspective on modern computing through studying
    its history.

The MANIFESTO is:
__________________________________________________________________________

> to run

__________________________________________________________________________
Topics and methods explored to an extent over the past 24-48 hours:
__________________________________________________________________________

- emulation : Atari 2600, Apple II, Commodore 64, their languages 
- (planning to cover systemd, dracut)
- UEFI boot > [focus : GRUB, etc.]  > userspace 
  - see dir 7_dsrv-emu
__________________________________________________________________________
CHOSEN PROJECT:
- an open-source software
  - a virtual machine,
  - an emulator,
  - or a video game that poses as an operating system (a la Last Call BBS).
    - Can I use the Unity Engine for that?
  - research dedicated toolchains. 
|
- maintaining the Linux kernel 
- An API / display server protocol for a 13h-like mode portable to any headless system. 
__________________________________________________________________________

- challenge: faithful resolution
- plan of attack:
  - fide: 320x200
  - now: 1920x1200, 6 times both ways.
  - consider fair, authentic scaling. 
- learn BIOS-kernel-API/DSP-distro ladder for that
