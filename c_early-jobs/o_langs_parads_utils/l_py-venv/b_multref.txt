"
String interning is an optimization technique where identical string values are stored only once in a shared pool so multiple references point to the same memory location.
"


"
For numerical variables, the equivalent concept is value caching or constant pooling, where identical numeric values may be stored once and reused rather than duplicated in memory.

"
Unlike string interning, which preserves identity and immutability for frequently reused text, numeric caching is typically limited in scope, value range, and implementation and is treated as a performance optimization rather than a language-visible feature.
