Invalid Shift : Shifting an integer value by an amount which produces an undefined result according to the C standard.




In C, an invalid shift occurs when you perform a shift operation on an integer value that exceeds the width of the data type or when you shift by a negative value. Here's an example that demonstrates an invalid shift:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int value = 10;
    
    // Invalid shift by a value greater than or equal to the width of int
    int invalidShift = value << 32;  // Shift by 32 bits
    
    printf("Invalid shift result: %d\n", invalidShift);
    
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we attempt to left-shift the `value` variable by 32 bits, which is greater than or equal to the width of the `int` data type (usually 32 bits). This results in undefined behavior because the shift operation exceeds the valid range.

When you compile and run this code, the behavior may vary. In some cases, you might get a warning or error from the compiler indicating the invalid shift. However, the program may still execute, but the result of the invalid shift operation is unpredictable.

It's important to ensure that shift operations in your code are valid and within the range of the data type being used to avoid such undefined behavior.
