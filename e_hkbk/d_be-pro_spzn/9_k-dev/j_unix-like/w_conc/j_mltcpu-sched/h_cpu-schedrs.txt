 - When the kernel works with the multiprocessor, how many CPU schedulers are there?
=======================================================================================

"
In a multiprocessor system, the number of CPU schedulers depends on the design of the operating system's scheduler. There are two common approaches:

1. **Global Scheduling (Single Scheduler):**
   - In this approach, there is a single global scheduler that manages the scheduling decisions for all CPU cores in the system. This means that all CPU cores share a common scheduling queue, and the global scheduler determines which task to execute next on any available core.

2. **Per-Core Scheduling (Multiple Schedulers):**
   - Alternatively, some operating systems implement per-core schedulers, where each CPU core has its own independent scheduler. Each core operates with its local scheduling queue and makes scheduling decisions independently.

The decision between global scheduling and per-core scheduling depends on the goals, complexity, and design considerations of the operating system. Each approach has its advantages and trade-offs.

- **Global Scheduling:**
  - **Advantages:** Simplicity, centralized control, and potential for effective load balancing across all cores.
  - **Challenges:** Potential contention for the global scheduling queue, which may become a bottleneck under high contention scenarios.

- **Per-Core Scheduling:**
  - **Advantages:** Improved scalability, reduced contention, and potential for better cache locality.
  - **Challenges:** Coordination and communication may be required for load balancing across cores.

Modern operating systems may use a combination of these approaches or incorporate hybrid scheduling strategies to optimize system performance. The specific implementation details can vary among different operating systems and versions.
