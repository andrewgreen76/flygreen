Making sure that the performance of the "virtual" chip meets the expectations - before the files are shipped to the
  fabhouse.

===================================================================================
CHECK (VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION)
===================================================================================

 . a.k.a. pre-si(licon)
 . the final checks
 . Verify that the design is correct and works as planned
 . Test the chip's functionality, performance, and power consumption
 . Validate the design against the original specifications


Tools used:
 . to ensure functional and timing correctness of the final netlist
 . Use various tools and techniques, such as simulation, emulation, and prototyping.
 |
 . for simulation - SPICE tools :			SPICE, HSPICE, Spectre, FastSPICE
 | for emulation - hardware emulators : 		Cadence Palladium, Synopsys ZeBu, etc.
 . for prototyping - FPGA prototyping platforms : 	Xilinx Vivado for FPGA implementation,
 |     		     	  	      			Intel Quartus Prime for Intel/Altera FPGAs
 |
 . for final check - formal equivalence checkers :	Synopsys Formality, Cadence Conformal, etc.
    |
    . "Formal equivalence checkers are used to mathematically verify that the synthesized or post-layout design
       exactly matches the original RTL specification."
