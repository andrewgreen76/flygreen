Yes, you can use the `xxd` command in Bash to view the bytes of a file in hexadecimal format. `xxd` is a command-line utility that can display a binary file in various formats, including hexadecimal and ASCII.

Here's the basic syntax to use `xxd` to view a file:

```bash
xxd filename
```

Replace `filename` with the name of the file you want to inspect. By default, `xxd` displays the file's content in hexadecimal format along with an ASCII representation on the right side.

For example, to view the bytes of a file named "example.txt," you would run:

```bash
xxd example.txt
```

This will display the hexadecimal representation of the file's content, which can be useful for examining binary files or troubleshooting issues in files where the text representation might not be meaningful.

You can also customize the output format and options with `xxd` to suit your needs. To learn more about `xxd` and its options, you can refer to its manual page by running:

```bash
man xxd
```

This will provide detailed information on how to use the `xxd` command.
