Purpose :


 . A direct write to storage would take a longer time. 


 . Instead , write()
 |
 .  ---data--> [fast buffer] -----> [disk] 


 . There is still the possibility of a crash after the buffer and before the write to disk. 
 |
 | => use fsync()
 |
 |  ----data---> [disk]
 |
 . fsync() returns true after all pending writes are completed
   => the app/process using fsync() can continue
