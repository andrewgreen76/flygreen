HDL is :
- a FUNCTIONAL language and a declarative language
  = inputs are unknown, not given within the implementation 
  = it is purely about conditions and behavior, not dynamic data manipulation 
    -= no altering procedures going on ; everything is static
  = no code and data compilation or interpretation

- The order of statements does not matter to the hardware simulator,
  but it does matter to us for the sake of readability.
