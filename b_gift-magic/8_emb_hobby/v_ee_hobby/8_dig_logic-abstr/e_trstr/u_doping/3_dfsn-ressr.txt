"
A diffusion resistor is a resistor formed by selectively doping a region of the silicon substrate (usually with
  boron for p-type or phosphorus/arsenic for n-type) to create a controlled resistive path whose resistance
  depends on the dopant concentration, diffusion depth, and geometry of the doped area.
