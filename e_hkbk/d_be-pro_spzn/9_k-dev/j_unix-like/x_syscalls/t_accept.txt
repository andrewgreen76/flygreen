A common example of a blocking system call in server programming is the `accept` system call, which is used to accept incoming client connections in a server application. The `accept` call is typically used with sockets and is part of the Berkeley sockets API.

Here is an example in C:

```c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>

int accept(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t *addrlen);
```

The `accept` system call is used by a server to accept a connection request from a client. It blocks the execution of the server until a client connection is established. If there are no incoming connections, the `accept` call will wait until one arrives.

Here's a simple example where a server is accepting connections in a loop:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <netinet/in.h>

int main() {
    // Create a socket
    int server_socket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);

    // Bind the socket to a specific address and port
    struct sockaddr_in server_address;
    server_address.sin_family = AF_INET;
    server_address.sin_port = htons(8080);
    server_address.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;

    bind(server_socket, (struct sockaddr *)&server_address, sizeof(server_address));

    // Listen for incoming connections
    listen(server_socket, 5);

    while (1) {
        // Accept a connection (blocking)
        int client_socket = accept(server_socket, NULL, NULL);

        // Process the connection (in a real scenario, this would involve further I/O operations)

        // Close the client socket
        close(client_socket);
    }

    // Close the server socket
    close(server_socket);

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `accept` call is blocking, meaning it will pause the execution of the server until a client connection is established. The server will then proceed to process the connection and go back to waiting for the next connection.

Regarding the term "persistent block," it's not a standard term. However, when we say a system call is blocking, it means that it can potentially wait indefinitely until the required conditions are met (e.g., until data is available, a connection is established). Whether the block is "persistent" depends on the nature of the system call and the specific scenario. In the case of `accept`, it will block until a connection arrives, but once the connection is accepted, it returns, and the server can proceed with processing the connection or waiting for the next one.
