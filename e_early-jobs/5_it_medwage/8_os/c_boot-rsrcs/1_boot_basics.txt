THE FLOW of a computer's booting process : 
 . power-on
 -> BIOS' POST
 -> boot device / OS selection (per the configured boot order)
 -> running the bootloader
 -> running the kernel + manager modules (incl. using device drivers)
 -> running system processes
 -> running the user space 


BOOTLOADER :
 . a small BIOS-level program with instructions telling the CPU how to load the OS data from the image into the RAM 


The role of the HARD DRIVE IN BOOTING :
 . The hard drive plays an integral role in booting - you need a physical host of the OS image to load into RAM before
     booting up the OS.


BOOT ORDER :
 . a BIOS will typically remember the order of the hard drives to go through in order to find a valid bootloader
 . the BIOS will load in the first bootloader it recognizes across the hard drives referenced in the boot order
