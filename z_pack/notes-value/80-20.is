The sentence "20% of their product actually accounts for 80% of their profit" is a statement about the distribution of profit among different products or services within a business. It is a common observation known as the "Pareto Principle" or the "80/20 rule."

The statement means that a relatively small portion of the products or services, which make up about 20% of the total offerings, generates a significant majority of the profit, approximately 80%. In other words, a few products or services are responsible for the majority of the company's revenue or profitability.

This principle is often used in business and economics to identify the most important or profitable aspects of a company's offerings. By focusing on these key products or services, businesses can optimize their strategies and resources to achieve better results. It's a way to prioritize efforts and resources on what really matters for the company's success.
