=== Streaming (printing) commands: ===============================================================

ls 	      	- list all files and directories in the working directory (code for "current directory")
cd [dir]	- go into this sub-directory
cd .. 		- go up to the parent directory

cat [file]	- streams contents of the file to the prompt
more [file] 	- streams file (to screen by default), scrolls in screen intervals, exits at end of file. 
less [file]	- streams file (to screen by default), scrolls in line intervals, exits at pressing 'q'.

echo		- streams a specific string (to the prompt by default).
		- Doesn't seem useful, but later we'll see why that's not true. 

pwd		- streams the path to the current working directory. 
		- Doesn't seem useful, but later we'll see why that's not true. 



=== Editors, etc.: ===============================================================================

emacs [file]	     - opens the file for editing in the Emacs Classic text editor.
      		     - You can try this with other, less sophisticated editors. (I'd definitely
		       advise against ed.)

clear	      - clears the screen, re-populates the prompt string. 



=== Filesys mgmt commands: =======================================================================

cp [path/filename] [path/filename]	- copies file/dir to a different path and/or with a different name
mv [path/filename] [path/filename]	- moves file/dir to a different path and/or with a different name
   		   			- That's right, this same command is used for renaming. 
rm [file]	   - deletes the file
rm -r		   - deletes the sub-directory



=== Searching commands: ==========================================================================

grep [string] [path/file]
- looks for the line containing the specified string (no quotes!) within the specified file. 
|
grep -r [string] *
- points out all files within the working directory with lines containing the string.


find [down-from-dir] -name [spec-file]
- lists the paths to all the files/dirs with the specified name. 
|
find [down-from-dir] -name "*str-in-filename*"
- finds the files/dirs with spec.str in name.       



=== Feeding commands/operators: ==================================================================

[command] > [file]		- feeds command output to a file, overwriting it
[command] >> [file] 		- feeds command output to a file, appending to it
[command_L] | [command_R]
- the pipe operator feeds output from [command_L] as an argument to [command_R]

tee
tee -a
