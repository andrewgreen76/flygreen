# Welcome to the experimental edutainment/tutorial repository. 

__________________________________________________________________________
The PURPOSE of this repo:
__________________________________________________________________________

To help individuals, with or without a technical background, to:
- fill in the gaps left by their formal education or, if they didn't have any,
  provide them with comprehensive alternative education; 
- improve their productivity in general (combatting ADD, figuring out
  alternatives to unhealthy solutions, etc.); 
- (especially for beginners)
  - hone their programming skills,
  - internalize key programming and engineering concepts,
  - learn about different systems,
  - understand and build a perspective on modern computing through studying
    its history.

- (TBA)
v too bold ; let's do something simple ^

CHOSEN PERSONAL PROJECT:
__________________________________________________________________________

- Just A GAME FOR DOSBOX is fine.
- own package -or- release / command. 
> |
> -
- a virtual machine,
- an emulator,
- or a video game that poses as an operating system (a la Last Call BBS).
  - Can I use the Unity Engine for that?
  - research dedicated toolchains. 
- challenge: faithful resolution
- plan of attack:
  - fide: 320x200
  - now: 1920x1200, 6 times both ways.
  - consider fair, authentic scaling. 
- learn BIOS-kernel-API/DSP-distro ladder for that 
- An API / display server protocol for a 13h-like mode portable to any headless system.
