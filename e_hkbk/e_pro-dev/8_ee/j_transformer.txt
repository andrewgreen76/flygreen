Transformer :
  (a) two or more inductors wound together 
  (b) a conductor (e.g., an iron core) with an inductor wound around two sides
     . the primary side and the secondary side
     . the magnetic flux from one inductor hits the other inductor , generating voltage
     . transformers can be used to "step up" a voltage (or "step down" the current) 
     . transformers can be used to "step down" a voltage (or "step up" the current) 
	. "This works based on the principle of **conservation of energy**, where the power (P = V Ã— I)
	   remains constant in an ideal transformer; when the voltage is stepped up, the current is
	   proportionally stepped down so that the product of voltage and current (power) stays the same."
     . transformers can be used to ELECTRICALLY isolate circuits
        . "To "isolate a circuit" means to separate it electrically from other circuits, often using components
	   like transformers or optocouplers, to prevent direct current flow between them while still allowing
	   signal transmission or power transfer."


Core :
 . "the central magnetic material in an inductive component"
 . "guides and concentrates the magnetic flux to improve efficiency and energy transfer"
