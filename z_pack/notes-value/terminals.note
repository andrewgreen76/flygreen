Where does Ctrl+Alt+F12 take me in Ubuntu Desktop?

In Ubuntu Desktop, pressing Ctrl+Alt+F12 (or any combination of Ctrl+Alt+F1 to Ctrl+Alt+F12) takes you to a virtual terminal or TTY (teletypewriter) session. These virtual terminals provide a text-based interface separate from the graphical user interface (GUI) of the desktop environment.

By default, Ubuntu Desktop has several virtual terminals available, and Ctrl+Alt+F1 to Ctrl+Alt+F6 are usually assigned to them. These virtual terminals allow you to log in with your username and password and work with a command-line interface, similar to a terminal.

Ctrl+Alt+F7 is typically reserved for the GUI session where your Ubuntu Desktop is running. When you press Ctrl+Alt+F7 from a virtual terminal, it switches you back to the graphical environment.

Note that the specific virtual terminal mappings may vary depending on the Ubuntu version and configuration. The Ctrl+Alt+F12 combination might be unassigned or have a different function on your system. The most common virtual terminals are Ctrl+Alt+F1 to Ctrl+Alt+F6, but some systems may have more or fewer virtual terminals available.
