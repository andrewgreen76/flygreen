Memory footprint refers to the amount of memory (RAM) that a program or process occupies while running. It represents the total memory usage by a program, including code, data, variables, and any other resources allocated in memory. A smaller memory footprint generally indicates a more efficient and optimized program, while a larger memory footprint may consume more system resources and potentially impact performance. Minimizing memory footprint is a common goal in software development to optimize resource usage and improve overall system efficiency.
