=== More aux. cmds and opers: ====================================================================

[cmd1] ; [cmd2]	- execute these commands in one chain. 

history	 	- brings up a history of the recently (successfully) executed commands
![num]		- executes the command indexed per the history 



=== Searching commands: ==========================================================================

grep [string] [path/file]
- looks for the line containing the specified string (no quotes!) within the specified file. 
|
grep -r [string] *
- points out all files within the working directory with lines containing the string.


find [down-from-dir] -name [spec-file]
- lists the paths to all the files/dirs with the specified name. 
|
find [down-from-dir] -name "*str-in-filename*"
- finds the files/dirs with spec.str in name.       



=== Streaming commands - deceptively practical: ==================================================

echo		- streams a specific string (to the prompt by default).

pwd		- streams the path to the current working directory.
