The Intel 80386 (i386) microprocessor introduced several notable advancements in the x86 architecture. Here are some of its "firsts":

1. **32-bit architecture**: The i386 was the first x86 microprocessor to feature a 32-bit architecture, allowing it to process data and addresses in 32-bit chunks.

2. **Virtual 8086 Mode**: The i386 introduced the Virtual 8086 Mode, which enabled multiple virtual 8086 environments to run concurrently within a protected mode operating system.

3. **Protected Mode**: It introduced the Protected Mode, which provided memory protection, multitasking support, and access to up to 4 GB of physical memory.

4. **Integrated Memory Management Unit (MMU)**: The i386 featured an integrated MMU, which enabled advanced memory management features such as virtual memory support and paging.

5. **Built-in Floating-Point Unit (FPU)**: Some variants of the i386 included a built-in FPU, known as the 80387, which provided hardware support for floating-point arithmetic operations.

6. **Enhanced Instruction Set**: The i386 introduced several new instructions and enhancements to the x86 instruction set architecture, improving overall performance and functionality.

These advancements were significant in establishing the i386 as a versatile and powerful microprocessor, laying the foundation for modern x86 computing.
