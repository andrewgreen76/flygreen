Small, random write :
 . any one-page write fed to the SSD , unrelated to other writes 

Log block :
 . SSD's write "buffer"  
 . alleviates op load on actual target blocks
 . when full , its contents are committed to SSD

HYBRID MAPPING : 
==========================================================================================

Features :

 (1) the LOG TABLE
     . a small, random write -> logical address --(map)-> a physical block 
     . an optimal number of a few LOG BLOCKS are reserved 
    
 (2) the DATA TABLE - for large , sequential writes



 . should reduce log-block count 



 . multiple pages <= multiples logical blocks mapped to the same block
 . one logical block <-> one physical page
