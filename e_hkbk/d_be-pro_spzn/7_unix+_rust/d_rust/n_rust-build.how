Was the Rust codebase written in C, C++, pure Assembly, or something else?

The Rust programming language itself is implemented primarily in a combination of Rust, C, and some Assembly code. The compiler and core components of the Rust language, including the standard library, are primarily written in Rust.

The Rust compiler, called rustc, is written in a combination of Rust and a small amount of C and Assembly. The Rust compiler is responsible for parsing, type checking, and generating optimized machine code from Rust source code. It is a self-hosted compiler, meaning it is capable of compiling its own source code.

While Rust is designed to be memory-safe, it needs some low-level components that interface with the underlying hardware and operating systems. For this purpose, some parts of the Rust codebase are written in C and Assembly. These components handle platform-specific operations, interact with system libraries, and provide the necessary low-level functionality that Rust relies on.

The use of C and Assembly in the Rust codebase is primarily for bootstrapping and interfacing with the lower-level system components. Once the Rust compiler and standard library are implemented in Rust, the need for C and Assembly code decreases, and most of the development and maintenance are done in Rust itself.

It's worth noting that while the Rust language is designed to be safe and efficient, the Rust compiler itself is built with a combination of languages, including C and Assembly, to interface with the lower-level system components and provide the necessary functionality to compile Rust code.
