It's time to resolve the issue with the Bash shell running some kind of a Firefox-related process after I open the browser and aborting the browser when I stop the process.

The output you're seeing when starting Firefox through Bash is the standard output and error messages generated by Firefox and related libraries. These messages are not related to the shell process itself, but rather the output generated by Firefox during its startup and operation.

To avoid having these messages displayed in the terminal, you can redirect the standard output and error streams to `/dev/null`, which is a special device file that discards any data written to it. This can be done using the following command:

```bash
firefox >/dev/null 2>&1 &
```

In this command, `>/dev/null` redirects the standard output (stdout) to `/dev/null`, and `2>&1` redirects the standard error (stderr) to the same location as the standard output. The `&` at the end of the command runs Firefox in the background, allowing you to continue using the terminal without waiting for Firefox to exit.

With this redirection in place, you should no longer see the Firefox output in your terminal, and you can close the terminal without affecting the running instance of Firefox.

... And who knows ? Maybe someday those output streams will come in handy for something. But for now let's not fiddle with that.
