To step back through multiple directories you've visited, you can use the `pushd` and `popd` commands in Bash. These commands allow you to manage a directory stack.

Here's how it works:

- `pushd <directory>`: This command saves the current directory onto the stack and changes the working directory to the specified `<directory>`. It also prints the updated directory stack.

- `popd`: This command removes the top directory from the stack and changes the working directory to the next directory in the stack. It also prints the updated directory stack.

- `dirs`: This command displays the current directory stack.

Here's an example to illustrate the usage:

```
$ pushd /home/user/dir1
/home/user/dir1 ~
$ pushd /home/user/dir2
/home/user/dir2 /home/user/dir1 ~
$ pushd /home/user/dir3
/home/user/dir3 /home/user/dir2 /home/user/dir1 ~
$ dirs
/home/user/dir3 /home/user/dir2 /home/user/dir1 ~
$ popd
/home/user/dir2 /home/user/dir1 ~
$ popd
/home/user/dir1 ~
$ dirs
/home/user/dir1 ~
```

In this example, we start by using `pushd` to move to different directories. Each time we push a directory onto the stack, the directory stack is displayed. We can use `popd` to step back through the stack and change the working directory accordingly. The `dirs` command shows the current directory stack at any given point.
