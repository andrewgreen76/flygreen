Why does the C programming language still receive criticism?


"
1. Lack of safety features: C is a low-level language that does not provide built-in safety features such as automatic memory management, bounds checking, or type checking, which can lead to programming errors such as buffer overflows and segmentation faults.

2. Difficulty in learning: C is a complex language that can be difficult for beginners to learn. It requires a solid understanding of computer architecture and memory management, which can be challenging for inexperienced programmers.

3. Prone to security vulnerabilities: Because C does not have built-in safety features, it is more prone to security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflow attacks, which can be exploited by hackers to gain unauthorized access to systems.

4. Lack of modern features: C is an old language that lacks many modern features found in newer programming languages. For example, it does not have built-in support for object-oriented programming or garbage collection.

5. Steep learning curve: C is a procedural language that requires a good understanding of programming concepts such as functions, pointers, and memory management. This can make it difficult for new programmers to get started with the language.
