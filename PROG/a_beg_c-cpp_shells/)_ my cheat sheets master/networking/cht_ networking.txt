 . Older telecom systems needed (1) a computer, (2) a modem, and (3) a phone 
   with a line. 

 . Client/server telecom is made possible with a modem: 
   + modulation - translating data (digital signal) into sound (analog signal).
     > All analog telecom signals are inaudible sound, starting at 96kHz 
	(sample rate). 
   + demodulation - translating analog signal into digital signal. 
 . A two computers - a client and a server - are also needed. 
   + dedicated software for networking on each device. 
   + a protocol. 
 . Older systems rely on cabled connection. 

============================= Basics of telecom: ==============================

Simplex: 
 - one-way com 
 - ex.: keyboards, monitors. 

Half duplex: 
 - two-way com 
 - turn-based 
 - ex.: Walkie-Talkies. 

(Full) duplex: 
 - two-way com 
 - simultaneous 
 - ex.: phones. 

========================== Importance of PROTOCOLS: ===========================

A protocol ascertains functioning communication between devices with 
the following parameters, known as ELEMENTS, agreed on: 
 - DIRECTIONALITY 
 - TIMING 
   . flow control - speed syncing between the client and the server. 
   . period of waiting for acknowledgment, response timeout. 
 - SERVER ID: identifying the intended server 
 - CLIENT ID: identifying the client 
 - LANGUAGE (and syntax) 
 - ACKNOWLEDGMENT of communication and reception 
 - PACKET DETAILS (encoding, formatting, encapsulation, header details, 
   datagram details, ...
 - SIZING: ... especially size. Every com link has a limit to its bandwidth 
   (transfer capacity). Large messages are resized (broken up into smaller 
   parts. 
 - DELIVERY OPTIONS: 
   . unicast(ing) - 1-to-1 com 
   . multicast(ing) - 1-to-1+ com 
   . broadcast(ing) - 1-to-all com 
   
 - (might also regulate the nature of the data) 


--------------------------- Wired telecom framework: --------------------------

	binary data	digital signal 		analog/carrier (el.) signal .. 
source >	> encoder > 	> transmitter > 	> transm. medium > ...
device + 		protocol;modem changes signal	cable
software		


 ... - noise on the line 	dig. signal 	binary data 	data 
> transm. medium > 	> receiver > 	> decoder > 		> dest. 
	cable 		protocol / demodulation (modem)		device + SW 


------------------------- Wireless telecom framework: -------------------------

	data		dig.signal 	analog signal (sound waves) 
source >	> encoder > 	> transmitter > 	> transm. medium > ...
device + 		protocol / modulation (modem)	
software		


		sound		dig.signal	data 		data 
> transm. medium > 	> receiver > 	> decoder > 		> dest. 
			protocol / demodulation (modem)		device + SW 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All of this makes up a protocol. 
 - A protocol is essentially a design.
