Yes, the Raspberry Pi 4 (RPi4) supports various graphics frameworks and APIs, although they may be more limited compared to those available on desktop PCs. The primary graphics framework used on the Raspberry Pi is OpenGL ES (Embedded Systems), which is a subset of the OpenGL graphics API optimized for embedded and mobile platforms.

OpenGL ES provides a set of functions for rendering 2D and 3D graphics, making it suitable for a wide range of applications on the Raspberry Pi, including games, multimedia, and user interfaces. Additionally, the Raspberry Pi Foundation provides libraries and tools for working with OpenGL ES, making it easier to develop graphics-intensive applications.

In addition to OpenGL ES, the Raspberry Pi also supports other graphics frameworks and APIs, including OpenVG (for vector graphics), EGL (for managing rendering contexts), and DispmanX (a Broadcom-specific API for managing display and composition). While these frameworks may not be as feature-rich as OpenGL on desktop PCs, they provide sufficient capabilities for most graphics applications on the Raspberry Pi platform.
