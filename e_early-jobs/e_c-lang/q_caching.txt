In C, caching data typically involves storing frequently accessed data in memory to reduce access time, often using data structures like arrays, structs, or buffers, managed manually since C lacks built-in caching mechanisms. Here’s a concise overview in one sentence followed by details and an example:
Summary: Caching in C involves manually storing data in memory (e.g., using arrays, structs, or static variables) to optimize access speed, requiring explicit management of storage, retrieval, and invalidation without relying on high-level abstractions.
Key Concepts

    Purpose: Caching stores data in faster memory (e.g., RAM) to avoid repeated expensive operations like disk I/O, network calls, or computations.
    Common Techniques:
        Static Variables: Retain data across function calls within the same program execution.
        Global Arrays/Structs: Store data accessible throughout the program.
        Dynamic Memory: Use malloc()/free() for flexible cache storage.
        Hash Tables: Implement key-value stores for efficient lookups.
        Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache: Track usage to evict old data when the cache is full.
    Considerations:
        Memory Management: You must manually allocate and free memory to avoid leaks.
        Cache Invalidation: Decide when to update or clear cached data (e.g., based on time or data changes).
        Thread Safety: Use synchronization (e.g., mutexes) in multi-threaded programs.
    System Calls: For file-related caching, you might use mmap() to map files into memory, reducing disk I/O.

Example: Simple In-Memory Cache with a Struct
This example implements a basic cache to store computed results (e.g., squares of numbers) using a struct and dynamic memory.
c

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#define CACHE_SIZE 100

// Cache entry structure
typedef struct {
    int key;           // Input value (e.g., number to square)
    int value;         // Cached result (e.g., square)
    int is_valid;      // Flag to indicate if entry is used
} CacheEntry;

// Cache structure
typedef struct {
    CacheEntry entries[CACHE_SIZE];
} Cache;

// Initialize cache
void init_cache(Cache *cache) {
    for (int i = 0; i < CACHE_SIZE; i++) {
        cache->entries[i].is_valid = 0; // Mark all entries as invalid
    }
}

// Look up value in cache; return 1 if found, 0 if not
int get_from_cache(Cache *cache, int key, int *value) {
    for (int i = 0; i < CACHE_SIZE; i++) {
        if (cache->entries[i].is_valid && cache->entries[i].key == key) {
            *value = cache->entries[i].value;
            return 1; // Cache hit
        }
    }
    return 0; // Cache miss
}

// Store value in cache
void put_in_cache(Cache *cache, int key, int value) {
    for (int i = 0; i < CACHE_SIZE; i++) {
        if (!cache->entries[i].is_valid) { // Find empty slot
            cache->entries[i].key = key;
            cache->entries[i].value = value;
            cache->entries[i].is_valid = 1;
            return;
        }
    }
    // Cache full: could implement eviction (e.g., LRU) here
    printf("Cache full, cannot store %d\n", key);
}

// Example computation (expensive operation to cache)
int compute_square(int x) {
    return x * x; // Simulate expensive operation
}

int main() {
    Cache cache;
    init_cache(&cache);

    int numbers[] = {2, 3, 2, 4, 3}; // Test inputs
    int result;

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        int key = numbers[i];
        if (get_from_cache(&cache, key, &result)) {
            printf("Cache hit: %d^2 = %d\n", key, result);
        } else {
            result = compute_square(key); // Expensive operation
            put_in_cache(&cache, key, result);
            printf("Cache miss: Computed %d^2 = %d\n", key, result);
        }
    }

    return 0;
}

Explanation

    Cache Structure: Uses a fixed-size array of CacheEntry structs to store key-value pairs and a validity flag.
    Initialization: Marks all entries as invalid (is_valid = 0).
    Lookup: Checks cache for a key; returns the value if found (cache hit) or triggers computation (cache miss).
    Storage: Stores new results in the first empty slot; could be extended with eviction policies.
    Output: Demonstrates cache hits and misses for repeated inputs.

Notes

    Scalability: For larger caches, consider dynamic allocation (malloc()) or a hash table for O(1) lookups.
    Eviction: This example doesn’t evict old data; real caches might use LRU or FIFO policies.
    File Caching: For file data, you could use mmap() or read into a buffer, as in your previous file I/O example.
    Portability: System calls like mmap() require <sys/mman.h> and are Unix-specific; standard C caching (like above) is portable.

This approach is manual and low-level, as C doesn’t provide high-level caching like Python’s functools.lru_cache. For comparison, Objective-C or Swift (from your prior question) use higher-level frameworks (e.g., NSCache in Objective-C or Swift), which abstract these details.
