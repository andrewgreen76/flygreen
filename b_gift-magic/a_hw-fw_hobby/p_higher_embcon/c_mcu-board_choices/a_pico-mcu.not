As of my last update in September 2021, the Raspberry Pi Pico is a microcontroller board developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation. Here are the specifications of the Raspberry Pi Pico:

- **System-on-Chip (SoC):** RP2040 by Raspberry Pi
- **Processor:** Dual-core ARM Cortex-M0+ running at up to 133 MHz
- **Memory:**
  - 264KB of SRAM
  - No built-in Flash memory for program storage (program is loaded into RAM from an external source, usually through USB)

- **GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) Pins:** 26 GPIO pins, which can also serve as SPI, I2C, UART, PWM, etc.
- **Analog Inputs:** 3 ADC pins (12-bit resolution)
- **Digital Inputs/Outputs:** 3.3V logic level
- **Onboard LED:** One LED (usually used for simple visual feedback)
- **USB:** USB 1.1 support for programming and power
- **Power Supply:** 5V USB, can be powered via USB cable or external power source
- **Programming Languages:** MicroPython and C/C++ (using the official SDK)
- **Dimensions:** 51mm x 21mm (small and compact form factor)

The Raspberry Pi Pico is unique among Raspberry Pi devices as it's not a full single-board computer like the other models, but rather a microcontroller board. Its purpose is to provide a platform for embedded systems and microcontroller-based projects.

Please note that there may have been updates or new models released since my last update, so I recommend checking the official Raspberry Pi website or other reliable sources for the most current information on the Raspberry Pi Pico and other Raspberry Pi products.
