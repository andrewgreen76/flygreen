When was the DNS protocol first officially deployed?
ChatGPT

The DNS (Domain Name System) protocol was first officially deployed in 1983. The initial specification for DNS, known as RFC 882, was published in November 1983, followed by RFC 883, which provided additional clarifications and improvements. These RFCs defined the basic principles and structure of the DNS protocol.

DNS was developed to address the need for a distributed and scalable system for mapping domain names to IP addresses and vice versa. It replaced the previous hostname resolution method, which relied on a centralized hosts file maintained manually on each computer.

The deployment of DNS revolutionized the way internet hosts were identified and located. It introduced a hierarchical naming structure and distributed database system that allowed for efficient and decentralized name resolution. DNS provided a scalable and resilient solution for managing the growing number of domains and hosts on the internet.

Since its initial deployment, DNS has undergone several updates and enhancements to improve its functionality, security, and performance. However, the core principles and architecture of DNS remain consistent with the original design established in the early 1980s.
