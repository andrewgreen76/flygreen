Protocol :
 . design (rules , specifications , principles)
 . every implemented protocol is designed for a specific purpose
 . examples :
    . Telnet - terminal access 
    . TCP - data transfer , NOT REAL-TIME (not live) 
    . IP - network addressing (assignment) 
    . UDP - resource-intensive REAL-TIME media transfer
    . SMTP - sending/receiving emails (middle)
    . DNS - domain name resolution (translation) 
    . IMAP - fetching and organizing emails (endpoint)
    . POP3 - server-to-client email transfer 
    . HTTP - web (media) transfer
    . HTTPS - secure web transfer
       . Zoom chat
    . SSH - more secure than HTTPS 
    . Zoom proprietary communication protocol 



Layer :
 . a level of abstraction of routines in a networking stack
 . each layer has its own set of protocols 
 . layers 2-4 - standardized with certain protocols 
    . transport (e.g., UDP - real-time, unreliable) 
    . network	(e.g., IP - addressing)
    . (data) link (e.g., Ethernet)
 . layers 5-7 - less standardized
