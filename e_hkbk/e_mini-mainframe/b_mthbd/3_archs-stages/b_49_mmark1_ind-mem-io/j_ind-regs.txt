"
An index register is a type of register in a computer's CPU used to modify operand addresses during the execution of a program, typically for operations involving arrays, loops, and other repetitive processes. By adding the contents of the index register to the base address of an instruction, the CPU can efficiently access a sequence of memory locations.

Hereâ€™s a concise definition:

**Index Register**: A CPU register that holds an index value used to modify operand addresses during program execution, facilitating efficient access to sequential memory locations in loops and arrays.
