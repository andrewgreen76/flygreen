In automata theory, combinational logic is a type of digital logic which is implemented by Boolean circuits, where the output is a pure FUNCTION OF THE PRESENT INPUT ONLY. This is in contrast to sequential logic, in which THE OUTPUT DEPENDS not only on the present input but also on the history of the input.
