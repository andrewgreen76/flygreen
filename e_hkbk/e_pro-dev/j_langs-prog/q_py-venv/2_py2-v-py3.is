Python 2 and Python 3 are two major versions of the Python programming language. Python 3 was introduced to address various design flaws and improve the language. Here are some key differences between Python 2 and Python 3:

1. Print Statement vs. Function:
   - Python 2: Uses the `print` statement (e.g., `print "Hello, World!"`).
   - Python 3: Uses the `print()` function (e.g., `print("Hello, World!")`).

2. Division:
   - Python 2: Integer division truncates decimal points (e.g., `5 / 2` returns `2`).
   - Python 3: Division always produces a float result (e.g., `5 / 2` returns `2.5`).

3. Unicode and Strings:
   - Python 2: Implicitly treats strings as ASCII unless explicitly specified.
   - Python 3: Strings are Unicode by default, and `unicode()` is removed.

4. xrange():
   - Python 2: `xrange()` is used to generate an iterator for large ranges to save memory.
   - Python 3: `xrange()` is removed, and `range()` behaves like Python 2's `xrange()`.

5. Input():
   - Python 2: Uses `raw_input()` to get user input as a string.
   - Python 3: Uses `input()` to get user input as a string (Python 2's `input()` is removed).

6. Exceptions:
   - Python 2: Exceptions are comma-separated in `except` statements (e.g., `except IOError, e`).
   - Python 3: Exceptions use `as` keyword (e.g., `except IOError as e`).

7. Iterators and Iterables:
   - Python 2: `zip()`, `map()`, and `filter()` return lists.
   - Python 3: `zip()`, `map()`, and `filter()` return iterators.

8. xrange() vs. range():
   - Python 2: `xrange()` returns an iterator; `range()` returns a list.
   - Python 3: `range()` behaves like Python 2's `xrange()`; no separate `xrange()`.

9. Libraries and Syntax:
   - Many third-party libraries have been updated to support Python 3.
   - Some changes in syntax (e.g., `print`, `except`) require modifications to Python 2 code.

10. Unicode Handling:
    - Python 2: Implicit encoding and decoding of Unicode data caused confusion.
    - Python 3: Clear separation between bytes and strings, explicit encoding/decoding.

11. Function Annotations:
    - Python 2: No built-in support for function annotations.
    - Python 3: Functions can be annotated with type hints.

12. List Comprehensions:
    - Python 2: List comprehensions leak loop variables (e.g., `[i for i in range(5)]`).
    - Python 3: List comprehensions have their own scope.

13. Long Integers:
    - Python 2: Has both `int` and `long` types for integers.
    - Python 3: Unified `int` type, automatically switches to arbitrary precision.

It's important to note that Python 2 reached its end of life on January 1, 2020, and is no longer receiving official updates. New projects and existing codebases are strongly encouraged to use Python 3. While migrating from Python 2 to Python 3 might require some adjustments, Python 3 offers many improvements and better compatibility with modern development practices.
