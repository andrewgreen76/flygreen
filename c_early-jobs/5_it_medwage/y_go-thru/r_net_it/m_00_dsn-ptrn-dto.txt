In the context of software development, DTO stands for "Data Transfer Object." It is a design pattern used to transfer data between different layers of an application or between the client and server in a distributed system.

The primary purpose of a DTO is to encapsulate data and provide a way to transfer it without exposing the underlying implementation details. DTOs are often used to overcome data serialization and marshaling challenges when data needs to be sent over a network or between different components of an application.

For example, in a client-server application, the server may use DTOs to package data before sending it to the client. The client then unpacks the data from the DTO and uses it as needed. Similarly, when data is sent from the client to the server, it can be packaged into a DTO before transmission.

DTOs typically contain only data fields and do not include any behavior or methods. They are meant to be lightweight and easy to serialize and deserialize. In some cases, DTOs may resemble the structure of the domain objects (the objects representing the business entities) but are separate from them to maintain a clear separation of concerns.

By using DTOs, developers can improve the efficiency of data transfer, reduce network traffic, and ensure that the data sent between different parts of the system is consistent and well-defined.
