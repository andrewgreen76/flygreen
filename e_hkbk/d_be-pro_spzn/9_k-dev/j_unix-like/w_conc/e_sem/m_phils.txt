Dining philosophers problem :
 |
 . five philosophers at a table					P0--f0--P4
 . separated by a single fork (five forks total)	        /	 \
 . sometimes a philosopher eats , sometimes he thinks	       f1        f4
    . when a philosopher eats , he needs two forks	      /	    	   \
 |    	     		      	   	     		     P1	    	   P3
 . every philosopher is a thread (P0-P4) 		      \		   /
 |  	 	     	  	 			       -f2--P2--f3-
 GOAL :
  . write get_forks() and put_forks()
  . no deadlock
  . no starvation
  . ideally : high concurrency (as many people as possible can eat at the same time)
