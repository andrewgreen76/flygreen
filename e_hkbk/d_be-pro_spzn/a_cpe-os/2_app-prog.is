Application Programming

Application programming is the process of creating software that runs on top of the operating system and provides functionality and user interface to the end-users, such as web browsers, games, word processors, and mobile apps. Application programmers need to have a good knowledge of the high-level languages and frameworks that they use, as well as the requirements and expectations of the users. Application programming is often more diverse, creative, and user-oriented, as it involves designing, testing, and deploying features, interfaces, and interactions.
