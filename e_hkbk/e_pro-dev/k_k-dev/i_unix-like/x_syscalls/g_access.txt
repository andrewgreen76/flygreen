The `access()` function in C is used to check the accessibility of a file or a file system path. It tests the accessibility of a file based on the permissions specified by the mode argument. The function returns an integer value, and the interpretation of the return value depends on the conditions checked.

Here is the basic syntax of the `access()` function:

```c
int access(const char *path, int mode);
```

- `path`: The path to the file or directory you want to check.
- `mode`: The type of access to check, specified as a combination of permission flags (e.g., `R_OK`, `W_OK`, `X_OK`).

The possible return values and their meanings are as follows:

- If the file or path is accessible according to the specified mode, `access()` returns 0.
- If the file or path does not exist, or if the specified mode is not allowed, `access()` returns -1.
  - In the case of -1, you can check `errno` to determine the specific error condition.

Here's an example of using `access()` to check if a file is readable:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    const char *filename = "example.txt";

    if (access(filename, R_OK) == 0) {
        printf("File is readable.\n");
    } else {
        perror("access");
        printf("File is not readable or does not exist.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `access()` is used to check if the file "example.txt" is readable (`R_OK`). If it is, a success message is printed; otherwise, an error message is printed using `perror()`.

Remember to include the necessary header file `<unistd.h>` when using `access()`.
