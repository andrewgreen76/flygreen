We want something that is ...
 . fast + maybe capacious (i.e., efficient)
 . reliable (robust)

===========================================================================================
RAID - REDUNDANT ARRAY OF INDEPENDENT DISKS 
===========================================================================================

 . idea for reliability - storing the same data on multiple disks
 . thought of as one disk ("logical disk") 
 . used in servers and data centers

===========================================================================================

===========================================================================================

 > multiple disks (HDD) 
 > VM (RAM) 	  	}
 > NVM (SSD) 		} b/c you need disk mgmt 
 > 1-2 processors 	}

===========================================================================================
MIRRORING VS. STRIPING  
===========================================================================================

 . redundancy (mirroring) - for reliability (recalling safe duplicate data)

 . non-redundancy (striping) - storing different pieces of data across different disks 
   . every piece is written to a block (sector) on a separate disk 
   |
   + parallelized distribution => less time to carry out the same I/O vs. doing it with a single disk
   + potentially saves seek time (b/c fewer blocks to R/W) 
   |
   - risk of data loss
