A crystal resonator or oscillator in a metal can operates based on the principle of piezoelectricity, where mechanical stress on the crystal lattice generates an electrical signal. The frequency at which a crystal resonator vibrates is determined by its physical dimensions and the properties of the crystal material.

Here's why a 10MHz crystal resonator/oscillator can't go any faster than 10 MHz:

1. **Physical Properties**: The physical dimensions of the crystal, including its thickness, length, and width, are designed to resonate at a specific frequency, in this case, 10 MHz. Altering these dimensions would change the resonant frequency of the crystal.

2. **Material Properties**: The crystal material itself has intrinsic properties that determine its resonant frequency. These properties include the crystal's elastic modulus, density, and piezoelectric coefficients. Changing the material would require a different crystal structure and composition.

3. **Manufacturing Constraints**: Crystal resonators are manufactured with precision techniques to ensure the desired resonant frequency. These manufacturing processes have limitations in terms of accuracy and precision, making it difficult to produce crystals with frequencies significantly higher than their intended design frequency.

4. **Resonance Modes**: Crystal resonators have multiple resonance modes, but typically only one mode is used for the desired frequency. Higher-order modes may exist, but they are not typically used because they can introduce unwanted frequency components and instability.

5. **Stability and Accuracy**: Operating a crystal resonator beyond its specified frequency may result in reduced stability and accuracy. The resonator may exhibit nonlinear behavior, increased phase noise, and decreased frequency stability, making it unsuitable for precise timing applications.

In summary, the resonant frequency of a crystal resonator is determined by its physical dimensions, material properties, and manufacturing processes. Attempting to operate it beyond its specified frequency would require significant changes to these factors, making it impractical to achieve frequencies higher than its design frequency.
