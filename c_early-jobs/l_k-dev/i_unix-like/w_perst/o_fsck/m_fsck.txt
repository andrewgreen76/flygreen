FSCK - FILE SYSTEM CONSISTENCY CHECKER 
===========================================================================================

 . introduced in 1980 on 4.0BSD
 

What it handles : 
 . S-blocks' corruptions 
    . compares the FS size to the num of alloc'd blocks 
 . reconciliation b/w bitmaps and inodes 
 . reconciliation of inode types  
 . dir entries
 . link counts
 . defective duplicates
 . dangling dir/block pointers (elimination) 
 . out-of-bounds pointers
    . located in inodes and indirect blocks 
    . pointers with addresses out of founds of the partition
 . 2-to-1 dir links 

  +---------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | . used in legacy file systems					|
  +---------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | - runs at a slow rate						|
  | - scans the entire drive even if the issues are few			|
  |    - got worse with larger disk capacities and integration of RAID	|
  |    => inefficient							|
  | => can take hours							|
  +---------------------------------------------------------------------+

 . reboot -> FS is mounted and ready -> [fsck]
