DNS is structured hierarchically. There are five types of DNS servers (like layers/levels of deeper queries). 


===================================================================================
TYPES OF DNS SERVERS 
===================================================================================

caching name servers : 

    store (least recent) resolutions locally , making it easy for the resolver to get the IP address
    helps with the plodding resolution overhead
    provided by ISP or LAN 
    they can also become recursive name servers 


recursive name servers :  

    they ask other servers if they know the IP address (a.k.a. full lookup) 
    (most are caching servers)


root (name) servers 

    all they do is DIRECTING queries to TLD name servers 
    a.k.a. root name server systems 
    a.k.a. “authoritative starting points for DNS resolution”
    there are a total of 13 distinct root server systems used worldwide
    each one has a unique IP address 
    each one is operated by a separate organization 
    all 13 are distributed (virtually replicated) to multiple servers with “anycast” 
    “Anycast is a network routing method where multiple servers share the same IP address, and traffic is directed to the nearest or best-performing one.”
    i.e. multiple servers would share the same IP address and the received DNS query would be sent to the best TLD name server 
    routing to the best server is based on location, congestion, the condition of the link, etc. 


TLD name servers : 

TLD : 

    TLD = top-level domain 
    the “top” part of DNS - far from the clients 
    the last part of a web address (e.g., .com) 
    every TLD has a corresponding TLD name server 
    distributed in anycast fashion just like root servers 
    i.e., a set of TLD servers can respond to queries with the same TLD 
    i.e., only one TLD server has to be systematically selected 


authoritative name servers : 

    b


The truth is a DNS server can perform SEVERAL OF THESE ROLES AT ONCE (with only one being imperative by design)

“DNS resolution follows a hierarchical tree structure, starting from the root servers down through TLD servers to authoritative servers.”
