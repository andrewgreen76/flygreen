It seems that the Emacs executable might not be symlinked to the expected location. The `snap` package for Emacs should create a symlink automatically, but it appears that it might not have worked in your case.

To resolve this issue, you can manually create a symlink to the Emacs executable. Open your terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
sudo ln -s /snap/bin/emacs /usr/bin/emacs
```

This will create a symbolic link from the `/usr/bin/emacs` location to the actual `emacs` executable provided by the Snap package.

After running this command, you should be able to start Emacs by simply typing `emacs` in the terminal.
