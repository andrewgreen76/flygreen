Ubuntu uses the "libinput" library for input device handling on Wayland. libinput is an input device management library that provides a unified API for handling input devices like keyboards, mice, and touchpads. It is widely used in many Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, for handling input events on Wayland.

Regarding KDE, Ubuntu's default desktop environment is GNOME, not KDE. However, if you install the KDE Plasma desktop environment on Ubuntu, it uses the Qt framework for graphics rendering. Qt is a popular cross-platform framework for building graphical user interfaces and applications. KDE Plasma leverages the Qt framework for rendering its graphical elements and provides a rich and customizable desktop experience.

It's important to note that the underlying graphics system for Wayland, including the compositors and rendering libraries, can vary depending on the specific distribution and desktop environment. Wayland compositors such as "Weston" or "Mutter" are commonly used in conjunction with Wayland. Additionally, graphics rendering libraries like "EGL" and "GLES" (OpenGL ES) are used for rendering graphics on Wayland-based systems.

Overall, the choice of graphics library and the specific components used in Ubuntu's implementation of Wayland and KDE Plasma may vary. It's always recommended to refer to the official documentation or specific sources related to the Ubuntu and KDE projects for the most up-to-date and accurate information on their respective graphics implementations.
