DIGITAL SIGNATURE ALGORITHM (DSA)
===================================================================================

 . asymmetric cipher
 . for signing and authenticating data
 . own method of generating keys
 . own method of signing and authenticating with key pairs
 . quality of security ~ choice of random seed value for the signing process
    . if the seed value is stolen or deduced, the attacker can obtain the private key


History of breaking:
 . 2010 - breach of security in Sony's PS3 game console platform
 . the randomized seed value was not getting re-generated for every signature
 . exploited by a hacker group called Fail0verflow
 . they quickly cracked the digital signature that secured a private key
 . that key was used by Sony staff to sign off on the software deployed to gamers
 . Signing off is necessary to tell the software that "the game hasn’t been tampered with, contains no malware,
     and is legitimately from the official developer."
 -> game piracy issue ensued


Other notes:
 . now a part of US FIPS
 . patented in 1991
