Mathematical induction :
 . - ?
 . n is always a positive integer
 . Always write out the assumption. 
 . Inductive step : prove for n+1
    . Assume : 2n + 1 <= 2^n
    . Prove : 2(n+1) + 1 <= 2^(n+1)
    . Proof : 2(n+1) + 1 = 2n + 1 + 2


Search algorithms :
 . binary - recursive
 |  . think a linear array
 |  . know and write quickly to save time
 |
 . A = array
 . x = the key we are looking for
 . lo = index of min
 . hi = index of max
 . n = size of input 
 . T(n) = running time given 'n'
 . recress ??
 . T(n) = T(n/2) + c
