Buffer overflow : 
. overwrites memory out of the intended bounds
. can happen with certain functions
  . strcpy()



Buffer overflow attack : 
. a vulnerability is exploited to inject ...
  . arbitrary data
  ! SOMEONE'S CODE
  . Even if the offending source code is not allowed to inject other code or data , it can still do other things. 
. can be used even against the kernel
. may crash the process or the OS
. "Assailants can ... rent out cycles on the compromised system if they successfully assault
   a network-connected user software (i.e., user code gaining kernel access rights)."

. return oriented programming (ROP)
  . injecter code :
    . a function in the process's stack can be pre-emptively rigged to return the address of injected code
  . injectee code
    . followed by a return instruction 
  . gadget : a piece of program code
  . return instructions can be rigged in such a way that the end of one gadget leads to another gadget 
  . this is a buffer overflow attack classic

. return-to-libc attack
  . an old-school attack similar to ROP
  . "The attacker carefully chooses libc functions that serve their malicious purposes. Common choices include
     functions like system() or execve(), which can be used to execute arbitrary commands or launch shellcode."



Security measures :
. denial of access to certain parts of address space
  . PTE has the inhibit bit
    . the set bit forbids execution of the page 
    . AMD x86 : NX bit
    . Intel x86 : XD bit
. address space layout randomization (ASLR) :
  . process segments are randomly placed within the address space
  . this makes it difficult to write malicious code to exploit the program in any particular way
  . typically , an attack on a process under ASLR results in a crash
  . the Linux kernel ended up with its own - KASLR (kernel address space layout randomization)
