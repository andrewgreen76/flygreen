A logic gate is simply an integrated (on-chip) circuit with a defined behavior, however simple or complex that behavior is.

Logic games can be :
- elementary (NAND, AND, OR, NOT, etc.) or
- composite (MUX, ADDER, etc.). 



There is more than one way to implement the same behavior. It can be done out of concern with energy efficiency or out of concern with cutting costs.
