Certainly! One specific example of how combinatorics is applied in network design and routing involves the optimization of routing tables in computer networks. Routing tables play a crucial role in determining the most efficient paths for data packets to traverse from source to destination in a network.

**Example: Routing Table Optimization**

Consider a computer network with multiple routers, each capable of forwarding data packets to neighboring routers. The goal is to optimize the routing table entries to minimize the number of entries and ensure efficient packet forwarding. This is particularly important in large-scale networks to reduce memory requirements and improve the efficiency of routing algorithms.

**Combinatorial Concepts Applied:**

1. **Graph Theory:**
   - Represent the network as a graph, where routers are nodes and links between routers are edges. This graph helps model the connectivity and relationships between routers.

2. **Shortest Path Algorithms:**
   - Combinatorial algorithms, such as Dijkstra's algorithm or the Bellman-Ford algorithm, are applied to find the shortest paths between pairs of routers. These algorithms use combinatorial principles to explore and evaluate possible paths efficiently.

3. **Routing Table Compression:**
   - Combinatorial techniques are used to compress routing tables by identifying common prefixes or subnets. For example, if multiple destination IP addresses share the same prefix, a single entry in the routing table can be used to represent them, reducing the overall size of the table.

4. **Wildcard Masks:**
   - Combinatorial principles are applied to the use of wildcard masks in routing entries. Wildcard masks help match multiple IP addresses with a single entry in the routing table, reducing the number of entries needed.

5. **Optimal Subnetting:**
   - Combinatorial optimization is used to determine the optimal subnetting scheme for the network. This involves dividing the IP address space into subnets to efficiently allocate IP addresses and reduce the size of routing tables.

**Outcome:**
The application of combinatorial concepts in this context results in a more compact and efficient routing table, leading to faster packet forwarding and reduced memory requirements. This optimization is crucial in large-scale networks where efficient routing is essential for timely and reliable data transmission. The use of combinatorial techniques contributes to the overall performance and scalability of the network.
