The absence of development boards with more powerful processors (such as those used in PCs or high-end embedded systems) that don't come with their own bootloaders can be attributed to several factors:

1. **Complexity and Cost**: More powerful processors often require complex initialization procedures and support various features, including complex memory configurations, peripherals, and interfaces. Designing a custom bootloader for such processors can be challenging and time-consuming, requiring significant expertise in low-level programming and hardware design. Additionally, manufacturing and distributing boards without pre-installed bootloaders may add complexity and cost to the production process.

2. **Target Audience**: Development boards are typically designed to cater to a specific target audience, such as hobbyists, students, or professional developers. Boards with more powerful processors are often targeted at professional developers or specific application domains where customized bootloader development may be more common. For hobbyists and students, pre-installed bootloaders simplify the initial setup process and lower the barrier to entry for experimenting with the hardware.

3. **Market Demand**: The demand for development boards without pre-installed bootloaders may be relatively low compared to boards with pre-installed bootloaders. Most developers prefer boards that offer a plug-and-play experience, allowing them to quickly start prototyping and developing applications without having to worry about bootloader development.

4. **Community Support**: Development boards with pre-installed bootloaders often benefit from extensive community support, including documentation, tutorials, and a vibrant ecosystem of software libraries and tools. Boards without pre-installed bootloaders may have limited community support, making it more challenging for developers to get started and troubleshoot issues.

Despite these factors, there are still options available for developers who require boards without pre-installed bootloaders. Some manufacturers offer development kits or evaluation boards that provide greater flexibility for custom firmware development, albeit at a higher cost and with potentially more complex setup procedures. Additionally, custom PCB design and manufacturing services allow developers to create boards tailored to their specific requirements, including the absence of pre-installed bootloaders.
