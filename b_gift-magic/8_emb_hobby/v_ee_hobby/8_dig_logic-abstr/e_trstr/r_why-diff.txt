BJT vs. MOSFET
===================================================================================

"
No, in most cases it will not work if you simply swap a BJT for a MOSFET on a breadboard, because BJTs are
  current-controlled (base current turns it on) while MOSFETs are voltage-controlled (gate-source voltage
  turns it on), so the biasing and drive circuitry are completely different — a direct pin-for-pin replacement
  almost always fails.
