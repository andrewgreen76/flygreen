TYPES OF PORTS 
===================================================================================

 . broken into three categories - by IANA
 . not all OS honor IANA's efforts
 . "the IANA registry of assigned port numbers is the most reliable [documentation] for determining how
    a specific port is [to be] used"


System ports :
 . 1-1023
 . for the MOST COMMON, SYSTEM-LEVEL, protocol-based SERVICES 
 . port 21 - FTP
 . port 992 - Telnet over TLS/SSL
 . most of these are still not assigned by IANA 
 . Modern OS on client devices do not use system ports for sending packets. A single dedicated system port
     cannot manage massive traffic, so the OS will assign an ephemeral port on the client. (See "ephemeral
     ports" below.)
 . Now a server "can support up to about 4 billion simultaneous sessions per IP address on the same port,
     limited by the 32-bit combination of client IP and client port numbers" (socket addresses).


User ports :
 . 1024-49151
 . vendors register these for OTHER SERVICES
 . some are assigned (by IANA), some aren't
 . ex.: 3306 - registered for MySQL (has its own database communication protocol) by IANA 


Ephemeral ports :
  . 49152-65535
 (1) can be TEMPORARILY used exclusively by clients for PRIVATE TRANSFERS
 (2) can be used for distinguishing a multitude of simultaneous unique connections between the clients and
     the same server via a gateway 
  . assigned/allocated by the OS
