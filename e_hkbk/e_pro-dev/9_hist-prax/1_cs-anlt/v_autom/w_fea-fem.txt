Finite Element Analysis involves splitting something down into millions of simpler elements
and running simulations based on how those elements might act. For instance, breaking a car
down into tiny shapes and using that to predict how it might survive a car crash. With Finite
Element Analysis, the more steps you can break something down into, the better you can model
and predict complex systems like the weather or nuclear explosions. This basically implied
an infinite need for compute.
