ORGANIZATION IN FLASH-BASED STORAGE : 
============================================================================


Data can be accessed in :
 . individual BLOCKS (1 block = 128KB-2MB)
 . individual PAGES (1 page = 1KB-8KB , 4KB avg.)
 . these work very differently from the more traditional disk blocks , RAID blocks , and memory pages 


A flash chip is made up of banks (or planes) of cells.
 . 1 bank = several blocks
 . 1 block = many pages
