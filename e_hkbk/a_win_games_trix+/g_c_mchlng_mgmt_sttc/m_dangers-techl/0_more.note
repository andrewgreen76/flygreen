    Memory Leaks: Failing to deallocate dynamically allocated memory when it is no longer needed can lead to memory leaks, causing a gradual loss of available memory.

    Double Free: Releasing the same dynamically allocated memory block more than once can result in memory corruption and security vulnerabilities.

    Race Conditions: Occur when multiple threads or processes access shared memory concurrently, leading to unpredictable behavior, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities.

    Format String Vulnerabilities: Occur when untrusted user input is directly used as a format string argument, potentially leading to information disclosure or arbitrary code execution.

    Insecure Memory Operations: Using unsafe memory functions like strcpy, gets, or scanf without proper bounds checking can lead to buffer overflows and other vulnerabilities.

    Insecure File Operations: Failing to handle file operations securely, such as insufficient file permissions, improper file handling, or lack of input validation, can result in security vulnerabilities.
