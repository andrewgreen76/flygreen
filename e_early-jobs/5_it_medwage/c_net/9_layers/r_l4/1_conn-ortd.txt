Stateful link :
 . accounts for socket states and data integrity
 . "the system keeps track of the connectionâ€™s status and context, such as sequence numbers, acknowledgments,
      or session information, throughout the communication" 
 . ex.: half-duplex - transmitting in one direction at a time
 . ex.: simplex - though one-way , it still accounts for socket states and data integrity 


===================================================================================
CONNECTION-ORIENTED PROTOCOLS 
===================================================================================

 . ex.: TCP
 . meant for stateful links 
 . Without it a single bad bit will render the entire chain of segments useless ... which is why we have RST. 
 . all data is properly transmitted via a connection
 . every segment is eventually acknowledged
 |
 . data is discarded per Ethernet and IP protocols (per a checksum)
 . it's the TCP nodes that decide when to resend it (broken checksum is one reason)
 |
 . Without TCP traffic might not reach its destination due to :
    . line errors (bits rendered bad mid-transmission)
    . congestion - and your packets may get demoted
    . broken fiber cable 


See if your traffic is important enough to be worth the OVERHEAD : 
 . establishing a connection
 . cumulative ACK transmission
 . closing the connection
