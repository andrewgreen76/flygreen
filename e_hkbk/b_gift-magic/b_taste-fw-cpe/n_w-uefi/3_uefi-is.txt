... While UEFI itself is a standard, the firmware implementations can still have vendor-specific variations.

The UEFI standard defines the interfaces and protocols that should be supported by UEFI firmware, ensuring interoperability and compatibility with different operating systems and hardware architectures. This standardization allows for a more consistent and modern firmware interface compared to its predecessor, BIOS (Basic Input/Output System).

However, individual vendors (such as motherboard manufacturers) can implement UEFI firmware with some vendor-specific features or configurations. These variations might include custom settings, additional features, or unique branding elements. Vendors have some flexibility in how they implement UEFI firmware as long as it adheres to the core UEFI specifications.

In summary, while UEFI is a standardized specification, UEFI firmware implementations can still have vendor-specific characteristics. This allows vendors to differentiate their products while maintaining compatibility with the UEFI standard.
