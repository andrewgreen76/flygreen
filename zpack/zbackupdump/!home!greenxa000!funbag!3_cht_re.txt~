======================================================================

(1) note: RM -R CAN BE USED ON FILES/leaves. They are just nodes after all.
(2) note: cmd operands can be LISTED WITH SPACES. 

======================================================================

Useful for:
 - folder/file search (one regex library)
 - grepping (text search) (a different regex library)

Used in: 
 - CLI utils: shells, sed, awk 
 - langs (need the regex lib)
 - RDBMS
 - WebDev (URLs, etc.)
 - data analysis, data manip.

*cs - all nodes ending with a spec'd character or a string (cs)
*cs.* - all nodes with a spec'd character or a string (cs.) in the middle.  

{} - range
{1..5} - a range of 1 through 5 inclusively.
cs{1..3} - nodes starting w/ cs followed by a spec'd range.
{1..2}cs{3..4} - more than one range can be used to multiply targets.
{01..10} - a re can account for the preceding zeroes.

!(subex) - perform on all, ignore the subex-spec'd nodes.
 - Isolate subex with ().
 - ex.: [cmd] !(se) . You do not write [cmd] *!(se) .
