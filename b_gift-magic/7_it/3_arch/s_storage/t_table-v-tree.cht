What is the difference between a file system table and a file system tree?

A file system table and a file system tree are two different concepts related to file systems.

A file system table, as I mentioned earlier, is a data structure used by a file system to keep track of the files and directories stored on a storage device. The file system table includes information about each file and directory, such as its name, location on the storage device, size, creation and modification dates, and permissions. The file system table is used by the operating system to locate and access files and directories on the storage device.

A file system tree, on the other hand, is a visual representation of the organization of files and directories on a storage device. In a file system tree, each directory is represented as a node in the tree, and each file is represented as a leaf node. The top-level directory, also known as the root directory, is the starting point of the tree and is represented at the top of the hierarchy. Subdirectories are represented as child nodes of their parent directories, and files are located at the leaves of the tree. The file system tree provides a structured interface for users to navigate through the storage device and locate their data.

In summary, the file system table is an internal data structure used by the file system to manage and organize files and directories on a storage device, while the file system tree is a visual representation of the organization of files and directories used by the operating system to provide a structured interface for users to access their data.
