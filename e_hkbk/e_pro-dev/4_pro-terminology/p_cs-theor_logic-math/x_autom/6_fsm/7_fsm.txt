WHAT IS A FINITE STATE MACHINE (FSM) 
===================================================================================

 . a model for a device or piece of software
 . represents a condition or scenario (state)
 . transitions between those states based on inputs - processing logic
 = "modelled behavior over time" 

 . the simplest MODEL OF COMPUTATION
    - a structure/framework/model for a machine WITH VARIABLES AND PROCESSING LOGIC
    - its STATES are monitored to observe (the correctness of) its behavior
    - discrete mathematics concepts such as propositional logic , proof by
      induction , and proof by contraposition are used to verify the correctness
      of the FSM's behavior (i.e., we want to make sure that the hardware/software
      does exactly what we want it to do , that the design/algorithm/logic is good) 
    
 . FSMs have little or no memory
