WEB PROXY : 
===================================================================================

 . simply put, a proxy for web traffic
 . old tech 
 . offered faster content retrieval as it was closer to clients than the web server and could cache retrieved
     content 
 . nowadays they are used for denying web requests for content unrelated to work (i.e., denying access to
     websites unrelated to work) 
 . “Modern web content is often personalized (cookies, sessions, geo-targeting), cached responses may not reflect
     each user’s unique version, so proxies usually respect cache-control rules to avoid serving mismatched content.” 
 . “The requested content is personalized after the web server dispatches it, typically during server-side rendering
     or by client-side scripts using session data, cookies, or API calls.”
