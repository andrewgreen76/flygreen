To require a password before running a Python script in a Bash terminal, you can create a simple wrapper script that prompts for a password and verifies it before executing the actual script. Here's an example:

1. Create a Bash script, let's call it `run_script.sh`, with the following content:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   # Prompt for password
   read -s -p "Enter password: " password
   echo

   # Verify the password
   if [[ "$password" == "your_password" ]]; then
       # Password is correct, execute the Python script
       python your_script.py
   else
       # Password is incorrect
       echo "Incorrect password. Exiting."
   fi
   ```

2. Replace `"your_password"` with the actual password you want to use for authentication.

3. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x run_script.sh
   ```

4. Now, when you run `./run_script.sh`, it will prompt for the password. If the entered password matches the one specified in the script, it will execute `your_script.py`. Otherwise, it will display an error message and exit.

Please note that this approach is not foolproof and should not be considered as a strong security measure. It provides a basic level of password protection but can be bypassed or reverse-engineered by someone with sufficient knowledge. For stronger security, you may need to consider more advanced techniques such as encryption or access control mechanisms.
