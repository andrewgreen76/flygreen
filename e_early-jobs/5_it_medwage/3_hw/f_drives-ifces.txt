STORAGE MEDIA INTERFACES (connections) : 
===================================================================================

AT - Advanced Technology
ATA - AT attachment

PATA (parallel ATA) : 
 . uses multiple connections in a cable for read/write operations 

SATA (serial ATA) :
 . uses one connection in a cable for read/write operations , serially transferring 1's and 0's 
 . SATA drives are HOT-SWAPPABLE - You do NOT have to turn off your machine to plug in a SATA drive.
 + actually transfer data faster than PATA drives
 <= "higher bandwidth and improved signaling"
 . used mainly for HDD interfacing ; few SATA cables can keep up with SSD's ; few SSD SATA hard drive models are made 

NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory express) :
 . the technology standard for SSD interfacing - THROUGH AN EXPANSION SLOT
    + greater bandwidth , greater efficiency in general (speed , energy consumption , etc.) 
 ... where as HDD's interface via a SATA cable


PCIe vs. NVMe : 
 . PCIe is the technology for inclusion of any I/O device through an expansion slot on the motherboard ,
     but NVMe is specifically for SSD's.
