Buffered input, a.k.a. buffered read :
- Hint : expects a string and hitting <Enter>. 
- Expl : At some point during runtime the program will use a buffer that will register multiple character inputs before the <Enter> key is pressed.
- Canonical : The state of expecting buffered input is called the canonical mode. 

Unbuffered input, a.k.a. unbuffered read :
- Hint : expects pressing a single key.
- The canonical mode should be disabled. 



In C all input is buffered by default.
