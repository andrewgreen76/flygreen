Yes, the vast majority of memory leaks typically occur in the heap rather than the stack. This is because heap memory is explicitly allocated and deallocated by the programmer using functions like `malloc()` or `new`, whereas stack memory is managed implicitly by the program's execution context.

In languages like C, C++, and Rust, heap memory is commonly used for dynamically allocated data structures or objects that require variable-size memory or a longer lifetime. If memory is allocated on the heap but not properly released with a corresponding deallocation function (`free()` in C, `delete` in C++, `drop` in Rust), a memory leak occurs. This means that the memory remains allocated even though it is no longer needed, leading to inefficient memory usage.

On the other hand, stack memory is automatically managed by the program's execution context and follows a last-in-first-out (LIFO) discipline. Stack memory is typically used for function call frames, local variables, and other temporary data. When a function exits or a variable goes out of scope, the stack memory associated with it is automatically deallocated. Therefore, stack memory leaks are relatively less common compared to heap memory leaks.

While memory leaks can occur in both the heap and the stack, it is essential to be particularly vigilant about managing heap memory allocations and deallocations properly to prevent memory leaks and ensure efficient memory usage.
