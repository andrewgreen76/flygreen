In the given code:

```c
unsigned int i = 1;
char *c = (char *)&i;
```

The second line is creating a pointer to a `char` (`char *c`) and assigning it the address of the `unsigned int` variable `i` (`&i`). This type of conversion is known as type punning.

Here's what happens step by step:

1. `unsigned int i = 1;`: A variable `i` of type `unsigned int` is declared and assigned the value `1`.

2. `char *c = (char *)&i;`: The address of `i` is obtained using the `&` operator, and then it is typecast to a pointer to `char` (`(char *)&i`). This means that the memory location where the `unsigned int` is stored is treated as a sequence of bytes (characters) starting from the least significant byte.

   The resulting `char *c` pointer now points to the first byte of the memory occupied by `i`.

This type of operation is often used for examining the individual bytes of an integer or for performing byte-level manipulations, especially in situations where the endianness (byte order) of the system might be relevant.

Keep in mind that the behavior of such type punning is implementation-dependent and might not be portable across different systems or compilers. It's generally safer to use specific functions or operations for tasks like extracting or manipulating individual bytes, especially when endianness considerations come into play.
