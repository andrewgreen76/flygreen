BUILD - PHYSICAL DESIGN
===================================================================================

Design:
 . a.k.a. layout implementation
 . Design the PHYSICAL LAYOUT of the chip
 . "CIRCUIT DESIGN is a subset of physical design, focusing on transistor-level schematics and custom cell layouts,
    whereas physical design encompasses broader steps like floorplanning, place-and-route, and timing closure for
    the entire chip.
   "
 . PLACE AND ROUTE the components on the chip
 . Ensure the design meets performance, power, and area requirements
 . Naturally, verification follows these physical design steps.
 

Tools used for physical design (place-and-route):
 . Cadence Innovus or Synopsys ICC2


===================================================================================
BUILD - PHYSICAL DESIGN VERIFICATION
===================================================================================

Tools used for physical design verification:
  2. for parasitic extraction : 		Calibre or Mentor Graphics  
  3. for static timing analysis : 		Synopsys PrimeTime or Cadence Tempus
  4. for DRC and LVS : 				Calibre or Mentor Graphics
