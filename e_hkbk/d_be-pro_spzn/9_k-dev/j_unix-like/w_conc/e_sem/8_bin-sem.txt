Binary semaphore :
 . a semaphore used as a lock that can only exist in either of two states : acquired and released.

A semaphore with three states (-1 , 0 , 1) is not binary.
 |
 .  1 - not taken
 .  0 - 1st peer thread is working , everyone else is ready
 . -1 - another thread trying to acquire
 |
 => In theory , no semaphore can be binary.
