Hi,

My name is Andrew Green and I am a long-time graduate of the University of Nevada, Reno (I was registered as Andrey Gaganov there at the time). I am interested in applying for an admission to UCLA. I am writing to you with a few questions and I was wondering whether some of them should be addressed to somebody outside of your office, like the Computer Science department chair or an individual who could function as a faculty mentor or an academic advisor.

First, below is a checklist that I have compiled from my research on the application requirements. Please let me know if anything from below is inaccurate or missing:

- Window of application for Fall 2024: Oct. 3rd, 2023 - Dec. 15th, 2023
- Three letters of recommendation - names and email addresses of recommenders (will be prompted for in the application).
- (optional) GRE - code 4837
- fee $135
- statement of purpose
- personal statement
- unofficial transcript
- (at the time of enrollment, directly from the undergraduate alma mater) official transcript 

Also, as I said, I have a few questions for your office or the Computer Science department. Feel free to ask them your own set of questions or forward this email to them, whichever is more appropriate (seeing that I could not find their direct number or email address). 

Question 1: I have a slightly complicated situation. It's been nine and a half years since I graduated from UNR with a B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering with a focus on games and simulation. Within that time my understanding of the job market related to the field has become much more informed and so my interests have changed. As someone who is looking to change his academic and professional focus from games and simulation to system administration or operating systems development for computers, I understand that to find work as a sysadmin or OS dev I have to land an appropriate internship. However, to get a relevant internship opportunity I have to be a current student (in my case going to pursue a M.S. in Computer Science). At this point I have two problems: (1) my transcripts are not very recent and (2) neither are the letters of recommendation that were written on my behalf during the period of 2014-2015 by people who might not even remember me by now. Given this predicament, what would your office or the CSE department have me go through with? Does that mean that I have to retake certain classes or take other ones? Do you believe I have to connect with my alma mater and work out some adjusements with them?

Question 2: I had a bit of a difficulty finding the page with the list of Computer Science programs. The best I could find is the following webpage:

https://www.cs.ucla.edu/research-areas/

Is this the page or is there a more comprehensive alternative? It seems like the Software Systems program would be the best fit for me.



I am looking forward to your response.

Andrew Green

- personal stmt 
"
Instructions are provided in the application and include a 500 words limit (approximately 1-page, single spaced, using 1-inch margins and 12-point font) as well as these or other prompts:

    Are there educational, personal, cultural, economic, or social experiences, not described in your Statement of Purpose, that have shaped your academic journey? If so, how? Have any of these experiences provided unique perspective(s) that you would contribute to your program, field or profession?
    Describe challenge(s) or barriers that you have faced in your pursuit of higher education. What motivated you to persist, and how did you overcome them? What is the evidence of your persistence, progress or success?
    How have your life experiences and educational background informed your understanding of the barriers facing groups that are underrepresented in higher education?
    How have you been actively engaged (e.g., through participation, employment, service, teaching or other activities) in programs or activities focused on increasing participation by groups that have been historically underrepresented in higher education?
    How do you intend to engage in scholarly discourse, research, teaching, creative efforts, and/or community engagement during your graduate program that have the potential to advance diversity and equal opportunity in higher education?
    How do you see yourself contributing to diversity in your profession after you earn your advanced degree at UCLA?
