What #Python questions have you seen used during interviews?

A few years ago, I was always getting asked about Python decorators. The trend I am seeing right now seems to be around the GIL

GIL is proposed for removal in PEP 703 - there are strong points on both sides of the debate - but the main reason for the proposal to remove being its an obstacle to multithreading. 

The big payoff for having a GIL-less Python is true concurrency in the language.

But getting rid of the GIL is far easier said than done. The GIL serves an important purpose. Its replacement must not only ensure thread safety but fulfill a number of other requirements, like, Not slowing down single-threaded programs, Not break backwards compatibility etc.
