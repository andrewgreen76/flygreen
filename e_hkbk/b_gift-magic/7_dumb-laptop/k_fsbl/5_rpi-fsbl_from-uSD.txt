The Raspberry Pi is capable of running the first-stage bootloader from a microSD card. In fact, this is the standard way that the Raspberry Pi boots up. 

When you power on the Raspberry Pi, the SoC's boot ROM initializes and loads the first-stage bootloader (bootcode.bin) from the first partition of the microSD card. This first-stage bootloader then proceeds to load subsequent bootloaders (such as start.elf) and the Linux kernel from the microSD card or another boot device, initiating the boot process.

So, unlike some embedded systems where the initial bootloader might be hardcoded into the board's firmware, the Raspberry Pi's first-stage bootloader is loaded from the microSD card, allowing for flexibility and ease of updating or modifying the boot process.
