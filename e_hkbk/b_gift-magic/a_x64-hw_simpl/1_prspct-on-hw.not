- Transistors are used to make gates.
- Gates are used to make latches, flip-flops, and multiplexers.
- And these are used to build half-adders, full adders, and ALUs.
- And these are used to build registers.
- And these are used to build memory components (e.g., RAM and ROM) and CPUs (and maybe even other complex units). 

- The MOS 6502 CPU chip (in the Apple II) has over 4,500 transistors.
