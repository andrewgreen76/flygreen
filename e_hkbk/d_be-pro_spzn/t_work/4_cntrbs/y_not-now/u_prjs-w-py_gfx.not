While open-source hardware and firmware projects may not predominantly feature Python code, there are some projects that utilize Python for various aspects, including graphics. Here are a few examples:

    CircuitPython: CircuitPython is an open-source variant of the Python programming language designed for microcontrollers and small embedded systems. It provides an easy-to-use platform for developing interactive projects with hardware. While not specifically focused on graphics, it enables integrating sensors, displays, and other hardware components.

    Pygame: Pygame is a popular Python library for developing 2D games and multimedia applications. It provides functionalities for handling graphics, audio, and user input. Although it is primarily used for game development, Pygame can be utilized for other graphical applications as well.

    Kivy: Kivy is an open-source Python framework for developing multi-touch applications. It is designed to create applications with rich user interfaces, including graphics, animations, and multi-touch gestures. It supports various platforms, including desktop and mobile devices.

    OpenMV: OpenMV is an open-source machine vision system that combines a microcontroller with a camera module. While the core functionality is implemented in C, OpenMV provides a Python API that allows users to program the device using Python. It enables performing image processing and computer vision tasks.

These projects may not exclusively focus on graphics but incorporate graphics-related functionalities as part of their broader scope. They provide opportunities to work with hardware and explore the intersection of software and physical computing.
