Pull-up resistor vs. pull-down resistor:
 |
 . "Pull-down resistors ... are commonly used in digital circuits to ensure a stable low voltage state at a node
 |  when no active signal is present, preventing floating inputs and ensuring reliable operation."
 |  
 . A ---pull-up resistor--- can help with building an inverting circuit ! 


Choosing the right value:
 |
 . "An ideal pull-down resistor typically ranges from 1 kΩ to 100 kΩ, balancing sufficient current draw to hold
    the line low without excessive power consumption."
