
What is a pull request?: Collaboration happens on a pull request. The pull request shows the changes in your branch to other people and allows people to accept, reject, or suggest additional changes to your branch. In a side by side comparison, this pull request is going to keep the changes you just made on your branch and propose applying them to the main project branch. For more information about pull requests, see "About pull requests".



A pull request is a feature in Git-based version control systems, such as GitHub, that allows developers to propose changes to a repository. It is commonly used in collaborative development workflows, especially when multiple contributors are working on a project.

A pull request serves as a request to the repository maintainer(s) to review and merge changes made in a separate branch into the main branch (often the `master` branch). It provides a way for contributors to discuss and collaborate on code changes before they are merged into the main codebase.

Here's how the pull request process typically works:

1. Fork the repository: If you don't have write access to the original repository, you can fork it to create a copy under your GitHub account.

2. Create a new branch: Create a new branch in your forked repository to isolate your changes. This allows you to work on the changes independently without affecting the main branch.

3. Make and commit changes: Make the desired code changes in your branch and commit them to the repository. Each commit represents a specific change or set of changes.

4. Open a pull request: Once you're ready to submit your changes for review, open a pull request from your branch to the main branch of the original repository. Provide a description of the changes and any additional context that may be helpful for reviewers.

5. Review and discuss: The repository maintainer(s) and other collaborators can review the changes, leave comments, and suggest modifications. This allows for feedback and improvements before merging the changes.

6. Make further commits and updates: If requested changes or improvements are needed, you can make additional commits to your branch to address the feedback and update the pull request accordingly.

7. Merge the pull request: Once the changes have been reviewed and approved, the repository maintainer(s) can merge the pull request. This integrates the changes from the branch into the main branch of the repository.

Pull requests provide a collaborative and transparent way to contribute changes to a codebase, allowing for discussion, feedback, and code review before merging the changes into the main branch.
