Fail-stop (recap) :
 |
 |
 . a way of responding to disk damage or corruption 
 . THE DISK IS RULED USELESS at the slightest issue 
 |
 . data corruption awareness : immediately noticeable
 . expected solution : DISK REPLACEMENT 



======================================================================================
DISK FAILURE TYPES : 
======================================================================================

Silent faults : 
 . a type of disk failure
 . pass ECC
 . go unchecked until a damaged block is requested
 . potential solutions : disk check utilities , JFS
 . latent-sector error (LSE) , block corruption 


Latent-sector error :
 . symptoms :	 INACCESSIBLE sectors 
 . causes :    	 physical contact , smears , cosmic rays
 . "Costly drives with at least one LSE are just as likely to have additional errors as cheaper drives" 
 . "The number of LSEs grows with the size of the disk" 
 . "Disk scrubbing helps identify more LSEs" 
 . "Spatial and temporal locality play a big part in finding LSEs" 


Block corruption : 
 . symptoms :   corrupted or misplaced data
 . causes : 	physical damage , write via a faulty bus , write to a wrong location (misdirected write) 


Fail-partial faults :
 . silent : accessing bad sectors , disk seems to work 
 . non-silent : accessing bad sectors => system lets user/client know
