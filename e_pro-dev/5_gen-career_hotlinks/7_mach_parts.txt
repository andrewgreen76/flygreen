Building a computer IS THE GAME. The problem is : this game takes a team of people with disparate skillsets. 

======================================================================================================

Choose what you want to fab :
 . motherboard PSU - parts 
 . CPU (core) - parts 
 . key encoder - parts 

======================================================================================================
==== MOTHERBOARD PSU : ===============================================================================
======================================================================================================

I want to build a computer. But which part ?
Start at the beginning. 

I want to build a PSU for a motherboard.
For that I need to study PSU's.
I DO want to learn how motherboard PSU's work , so I'll design and build one.

==== COMPILER <- CPU : ===============================================================================
======================================================================================================

I'll be writing code before it's processed by the compiler.
For that I need to know how a compiler works.
I DO want to know how a compiler works , so I'll develop one. 

I'll be developing a compiler.
For that I need to know how hardware (CPU, RAM, ROM, storage) works.
I DO want to know how designed and manufactured hardware works , so I'll design it. 

I'll be designing hardware.
Not all hardware is alike. The question is: What kind of hardware do I want to design? What is the simplest kind of hardware to design?
Or what type of hardware looks most attractive ?

 . CPU
 . storage
 . RAM/ROM
 |
 . SoC 
 . MCU (includes CPU, RAM, etc.) 

======================================================================================================
==== CPU CORE : ======================================================================================
======================================================================================================

I want to study CPU cores.
|
I want to figure out the best clock speed. 
For that I need to understand the relationship between the clock and the rest of the hardware. 
I used to want to learn this , so I'll just have to get in the mood for it. 
|
I want to determine and design computational capabilities of a CPU.
 . signed full adder (w/ subtraction)
 . multiplication and division
 . root extraction , logarithm computation , exponentiation 
For that I need to understand ISA's. 
I used to want to learn all of these , so I'll just have to get in the mood for it. 

For that I need to understand types of cores.
I used to want to learn all of these , so I'll just have to get in the mood for it. 

For that I need to understand pipeline stages.
I used to want to learn all of these , so I'll just have to get in the mood for it. 

For that I need to understand execution units. 
I used to want to learn all of these , so I'll just have to get in the mood for it. 

For that I need to understand the relationship between the clock and the rest of the hardware. 
I used to want to learn all of these , so I'll just have to get in the mood for it. 

CPU fab machinery :

==== KEY ENCODER IC : ================================================================================
======================================================================================================

I'll be designing hardware.
Not all hardware is alike. The question is: What kind of hardware do I want to design? What is the simplest kind of hardware to design?
 . controller logic IC (e.g., a key encoder) 

I'll be designing a key encoder logic IC. 
For that I need to know how a key encoder works. 

MM74C922
AVR243

Key encoder IC - fab machinery :

======================================================================================================
(a) I don't even know how that works. 
(b) I don't care how it works ; I just want it to work.
