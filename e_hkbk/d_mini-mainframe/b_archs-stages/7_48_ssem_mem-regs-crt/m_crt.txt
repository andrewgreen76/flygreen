The Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM) provided computation output primarily through a cathode ray tube (CRT) display. Hereâ€™s how it worked:

1. **CRT Display**: The results of computations were displayed directly on a CRT screen. The Williams tube, used for memory, could be connected to an output display tube where the binary data stored in the memory was visually represented as dots.

2. **Human Interpretation**: Operators would interpret the patterns of dots on the CRT to understand the output. This required familiarity with the binary data format and the specific encoding used by the machine.

3. **Output Devices**: In some instances, the output could be manually transcribed or copied from the CRT display to paper for further analysis.

The SSEM did not have advanced output devices like printers or teletypes initially, so its output was mainly visual and required human interpretation.
