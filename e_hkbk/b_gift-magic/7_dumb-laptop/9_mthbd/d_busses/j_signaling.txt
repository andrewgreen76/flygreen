2002 - TRANSITION-MINIMIZED DIFFERENTIAL SIGNALING : 
========================================================================================

"
TMDS stands for Transition Minimized Differential Signaling. It is a technology used in digital video interfaces, particularly in DVI (Digital Visual Interface) and HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) connections. TMDS is employed to transmit high-speed digital video data from a source device, such as a computer or DVD player, to a display device, such as a monitor or television.

TMDS works by encoding digital video data into a serial stream of differential signals, which are then transmitted over a cable. The transition minimized aspect of TMDS refers to the encoding method used to minimize electromagnetic interference (EMI) and signal degradation during transmission. By minimizing the number of signal transitions, TMDS helps to ensure reliable and high-quality transmission of digital video data over longer distances.

In HDMI and DVI connections, TMDS is used to transmit video data along with other essential information, such as audio, control signals, and display information. It plays a crucial role in enabling high-resolution and high-quality digital video output in modern multimedia systems.

Here are a few key dates related to the development and evolution of differential signaling:

1. **1920s-1930s:** Early research into balanced signaling techniques begins, laying the groundwork for later developments in differential signaling.

2. **1940s-1950s:** Differential signaling techniques are employed in telecommunications systems to improve noise immunity and signal integrity over long-distance communication links, such as telephone lines.

3. **1960s-1970s:** Further advancements in differential signaling techniques occur, driven by the growing demand for reliable communication in telecommunication and early computer networking applications.

4. **Late 1980s-1990s:** Differential signaling becomes increasingly prevalent in digital communication systems, with the adoption of standards like RS-485 and LVDS (Low-Voltage Differential Signaling) in various applications.

5. **2000s-Present:** Differential signaling continues to evolve and find widespread adoption in modern digital interfaces and high-speed data transmission protocols, including technologies such as USB, SATA, PCIe, and HDMI.

These dates provide a general timeline of the development and adoption of differential signaling principles over the years.
