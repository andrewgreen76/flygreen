Certainly! Here's an example of a "Hello World" code written in Cython:

```cython
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")

# Python module initialization
def main():
    hello_world()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In the above code, the `hello_world` function prints the "Hello, World!" message. The `main` function is used to call `hello_world` function. Finally, the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block ensures that `main` function is executed when the module is run directly.

To compile and run the Cython code, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Save the code in a file with a `.pyx` extension (e.g., `hello_world.pyx`).

2. Compile the `.pyx` file to generate the corresponding C code using the Cython compiler. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the `.pyx` file, and run the following command:

   ```
   cythonize -i hello_world.pyx
   ```

   This command compiles the Cython code and generates a `.c` file.

3. Once the compilation is successful, you will have a compiled module. You can now import and use the module in your Python code:

   ```python
   import hello_world

   hello_world.hello_world()
   ```

   Running the Python code will print the "Hello, World!" message.

Please note that you'll need to have Cython installed on your system to compile the `.pyx` file. You can install Cython using tools like `pip`:

```
pip install cython
```

Make sure you have a C compiler installed as well, as it's required to compile the generated C code.

By compiling Cython code, you can achieve better performance compared to pure Python code, especially when dealing with computationally intensive tasks or integrating with existing C/C++ codebases.
