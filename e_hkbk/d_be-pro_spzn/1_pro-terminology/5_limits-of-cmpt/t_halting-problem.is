The halting problem is a fundamental problem in computer science that relates to the predictability of program behavior. It was first formulated by Alan Turing in 1936. The problem asks whether it is possible to determine, in a general sense, whether a given program will halt (terminate) or continue running indefinitely for all possible inputs.

More formally, the halting problem can be stated as follows: Given a program and its input, is it possible to write a general algorithm that can determine, with certainty, whether the program will eventually halt or run forever?

Alan Turing proved that there is no algorithm that can solve the halting problem for all possible programs. In other words, there is no general method that can determine, in all cases, whether a program will halt or not. This result has significant implications for the limits of computation and program analysis.

The halting problem has played a fundamental role in theoretical computer science and has influenced various fields such as formal languages, computability theory, and algorithmic complexity. It demonstrates the existence of undecidable problems, for which no algorithmic solution exists.
