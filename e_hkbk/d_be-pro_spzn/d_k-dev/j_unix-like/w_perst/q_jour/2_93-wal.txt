WRITE-AHEAD LOGGING (WAL) : 
==================================================================================================================

 . alternative to the slower `fsck`


Logging intended file changes before performing them :
 |
 . in the `struct journal` 
 . kept between a superblock and a block group somewhere in the middle of the disk
 + intended file ops 
 . metadata may be logged
 . data may also be logged 
   

Crash -> recovery -> outcomes using the journal : 
 (a) initial state of FS is regained
 (b) final state of FS is achieved
