Parity :
 . a method of enforcing data integrity across RAID
 . parity bits accompany data
    . stored parity 	<- 
    . calculated parity <- from the RAID controller or the host's CPU 
    . error-checking : comparing parity bits 
 . need a parity disk 


Odd parity :
 . 1's in data + parity bit = odd (1)
 => 1's in data
 . odd (1) = (sum+1)%2 
 . even (0) = (sum+1)%2 


Parity checks :
 . error-checking
 . fault tolerance
 . reconstruction after disk failure
