    Learning more and more about customization of my Bash ecosystem for the sake of
minimizing my annoyance with some of its transient aspects and thereby maximizing
my productivity, I've learned about the nature of different teletype prompts -
 - the shell, the username/password auth, ... and ... who knows what else is there.
The takeaway here is that auth prompts do not accept shell keybindings or escape
sequences. Sad, as a more friendly functionality would actually let me populate my
login and password instantly, saving me the time and the patience. According to
ChatGPT, there is a way to get Emacs and Bash to share the same text buffer, but
this is getting too involved for me and I'm just tired and need a recharge.

    ...

    Up and running and reporting again. I need to do something about this whiteboard
and I'm going to clear it out. Here's what I have on it, and this will be preserved
here for personal development reasons:
