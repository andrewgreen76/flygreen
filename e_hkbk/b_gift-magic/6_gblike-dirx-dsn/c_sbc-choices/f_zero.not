Certainly, here are the specifications of the original Raspberry Pi Zero (without wireless capabilities):

- **System-on-Chip (SoC):** BCM2835 by Broadcom
- **Processor:** ARM1176JZF-S running at 1 GHz (single-core)
- **Memory:**
  - 512MB of LPDDR2 SDRAM
  - No built-in Flash memory for program storage (program is loaded into RAM from an external source, usually a microSD card)

- **GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) Pins:** 40 GPIO pins
- **Video Output:** mini-HDMI port (1080p60 video output)
- **Camera Connector:** CSI camera connector for connecting the Raspberry Pi Camera Module
- **USB:** One micro-USB OTG (On-The-Go) port for power and data
- **Power Supply:** 5V via micro-USB or GPIO header
- **Dimensions:** 65mm x 30mm (compact form factor)

The original Raspberry Pi Zero offers similar specifications to the Raspberry Pi Zero W, but it lacks the wireless capabilities (Wi-Fi and Bluetooth) found in the Zero W variant. It's important to note that while the Raspberry Pi Zero does not have built-in wireless connectivity, users can add wireless functionality using external USB adapters or other compatible hardware.

Please note that there may have been updates or new models released since my last update, so I recommend checking the official Raspberry Pi website or other reliable sources for the most current information on the Raspberry Pi Zero and its variants.
