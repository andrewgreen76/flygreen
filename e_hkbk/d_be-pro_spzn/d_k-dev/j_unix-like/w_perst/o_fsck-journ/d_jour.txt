==================================================================================================================
JOURNALING - LOGGING FILE WRITE OPS AS BACKUP : 
==================================================================================================================

 . a.k.a. write-ahead logging 
 . will come in handy in the event of a crash / power outage
 |
 . individual changes made to file by user = atomic units of work called TRANSACTIONS 
    = file write ops
    = write transactions
    = changes to FS  
 . the FS may decide to [ROLL BACK] file changes (revert write transactions to target) 
 . the FS may decide to [REPLAY] file changes (finish write transactions to target) 



==================================================================================================================
PROS / CONS :
==================================================================================================================

 + unlike fsck , jounaling targets exact recovery point
    => faster recovery 
 - as an update phase, journaling increases update completion time 



==================================================================================================================
JOURNALING IN ACTION : 
==================================================================================================================

1) LOG transactions from the RAM into the [JOURNAL STRUCTURE] in FS. 
   . between a superblock and a block group somewhere in the middle of the disk
   . [FINAL STATE] of file system is secured 

2) Securing [INITIAL STATE] of file system : 
   . undo logging : the inverse of every little write-op is logged in the journal 
   . copy-on-write : old state of [bitmaps , inodes , data] is copied



History of use : 
 . introduced with the release of the ext3 Linux file system
 . in 2001 
 . still used in modern systems
