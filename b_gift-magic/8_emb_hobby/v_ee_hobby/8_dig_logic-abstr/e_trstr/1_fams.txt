LOGIC FAMILIES
===================================================================================

"A logic family is a group of integrated circuits that implement digital logic functions using a consistent technology,
  voltage levels, speed, power consumption, and pin compatibility (e.g., TTL or CMOS)."

"There are many logic families beyond TTL and CMOS, including ECL, NMOS, PMOS, BiCMOS, and GaAs, each optimized for
  specific speed, power, or application needs."
