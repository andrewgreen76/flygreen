# Welcome to the experimental edutainment/tutorial repository. 

__________________________________________________________________________
The PURPOSE of this repo:
__________________________________________________________________________

To help individuals, with or without a technical background, to:
- fill in the gaps left by their formal education or, if they didn't have any,
  provide them with comprehensive alternative education; 
- improve their productivity in general (combatting ADD, figuring out
  alternatives to unhealthy solutions, etc.); 
- (especially for beginners)
  - hone their programming skills,
  - internalize key programming and engineering concepts,
  - learn about different systems,
  - understand and build a perspective on modern computing through studying
    its history.
    
__________________________________________________________________________
The MANIFESTO is:
__________________________________________________________________________

> to run
  - to use for practical or artistic reasons
> to share
  - to show off
> to study
  - to learn
> to modify
  - to hack ethically and creatively
  
JAtQ - Just Answer the Question:
- any question brought up to anyone involved in education must be answered
  without an inkling of annoyance or personality. 

__________________________________________________________________________
TOPICS AND METHODS EXPLORED TO AN EXTENT OVER THE PAST 24-48 HOURS:
__________________________________________________________________________

- aspects of the Linux kernel : process scheduling/mgmt, I/O handing, memgmt, etc. 
- Bash :
  - awk , sed ;
  - string matching & string capturing with BASH_REMATCH =~ operator. 
- hardware-level caching vs. software-level caching, techniques 
- endian-ness 
- C :
  - syntax of I/O
  - syntax of method signature in a function definition (oh, those char array references)

CHOSEN PROFESSIONAL PROJECT:

- (TBA)
v too bold ; let's do something simple ^ 
- maintaining [the Linux kernel] >>>or<<< systemd

CHOSEN PERSONAL PROJECT:
__________________________________________________________________________

- Just A GAME FOR DOSBOX is fine.
- own package -or- release / command. 
> |
> -
- a virtual machine,
- an emulator,
- or a video game that poses as an operating system (a la Last Call BBS).
  - Can I use the Unity Engine for that?
  - research dedicated toolchains. 
- challenge: faithful resolution
- plan of attack:
  - fide: 320x200
  - now: 1920x1200, 6 times both ways.
  - consider fair, authentic scaling. 
- learn BIOS-kernel-API/DSP-distro ladder for that 
- An API / display server protocol for a 13h-like mode portable to any headless system.
