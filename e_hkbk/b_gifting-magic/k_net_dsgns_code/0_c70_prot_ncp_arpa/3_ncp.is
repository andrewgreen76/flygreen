The first widely recognized client-server protocol is the Network Control Program (NCP), which was developed in the late 1960s as part of the ARPANET project. ARPANET, the precursor to the modern internet, was a research network funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the United States Department of Defense.

NCP provided the foundation for communication between host computers on the ARPANET. It allowed for the exchange of data between a client computer and a server computer over the network. The client-server model, where a client requests services or resources from a server, was first implemented with NCP.

NCP handled basic functions such as establishing and terminating connections, flow control, and error detection. It allowed remote login, file transfer, and remote execution of commands.

However, it is important to note that NCP was eventually replaced by the TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) suite, which is the foundation of the modern internet. TCP/IP introduced more robust and scalable protocols, including TCP, UDP, IP, and others, that are still widely used today.

While NCP was an early client-server protocol, it primarily operated within the confines of the ARPANET network. The TCP/IP suite, with its standardized and interoperable protocols, played a crucial role in the development and expansion of the internet as we know it today.
