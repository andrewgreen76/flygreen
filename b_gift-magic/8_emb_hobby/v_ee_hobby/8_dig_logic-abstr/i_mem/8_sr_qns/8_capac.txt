HOW CAPACITANCE WORKS
===================================================================================

"Capacitance is the physical property of a system that stores electric charge per unit voltage due to the
 separation of conductors by an electric field."

"An electric field exerts a force on electric charge, causing charges to move or redistribute depending on
 their sign and mobility."

"Separating conductors with an insulating region lets an electric field push charges onto opposite conductors, preventing recombination and thereby storing charge as field energy."

"Recombination is the process where positive and negative charges meet and neutralize each other, releasing energy."

"... a capacitor temporarily deters charge from neutralizing by holding it on separated conductors."

"An electric field forms between the separated conductors because the accumulated positive and negative charges
 create a voltage difference across the insulating gap."
