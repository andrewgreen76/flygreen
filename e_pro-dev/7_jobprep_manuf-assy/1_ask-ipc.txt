Depends on the apprenticeship : 
 . Do I have to be a current student / recent graduate ? 
 . Do I have to have a degree in EE, IE, etc. ? 
 . Do I have to have a CA ID ? Or does it depend on the course track or cert ? 

 . How do students attend all of the program-specific courses in one locale ? 
 . In what location do your students tied to any one apprenticeship program go through all of their classes - in spite of the fact that     different training centers offer different sets of courses ?
