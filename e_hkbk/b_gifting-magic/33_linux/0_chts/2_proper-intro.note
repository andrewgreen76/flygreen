PREAMBLE - THE MISSION of this repository, further INSTRUCTIONS: 
===============================================================

    This is an educational repository at the heart of which is my
personal manifesto - "Learn whatever you want, learn however you 
want to, and learn whenever you want to". That being said, you will
notice that there is a kind of a linear pattern to the educational
flow and structure of this repo. And there is a sense to that
pattern. The idea is to employ cool hacking methods to achieve
the following: (1) allow students to find joy in computer
programming; (2) let them discover who they really are as
programmers and engineers; and (3) help them hone their skills in
a discipline of their choosing. 

. If you are new to Linux and the Bash shell, welcome!

. If you are new to GitHub and reading this from within my GitHub
  account via Windows, macOS, or some other platform, ... well,
  I guess that's not so bad. At least you have a wonderful platform
  powerful and resourceful enough to give you the access to other
  platforms that can educate you on how to use GitHub. However,
  if you have at least one good reason to learn to use 

this Git repository right here is for those who are looking 
  insist on learning how a version control system (a massive
  software that allows you to store your software development
  projects)
  works with the Bash shell, a text-based program that allows
  the general user interact with the Linux operating system, I will
  have some instructions for you that you will have to follow
  yourselves. 

. I don't have anything to say to the rest of you. Sorry. You
  can always figure anything out.
