# Welcome to the experimental edutainment/multi-tutorial repository. 

__________________________________________________________________________
The PURPOSE of this repo:
__________________________________________________________________________

To help individuals, with or without a technical background, to:
- fill in the gaps left by their formal education or, if they didn't have any,
  provide them with comprehensive alternative education;
  - (especially for beginners)
    - hone their programming skills,
    - internalize key programming and engineering concepts,
    - learn about different systems,
    - understand and build a perspective on modern computing through studying
      its history.
- grow a portfolio; 
- improve their productivity in general (combatting ADD, figuring out
  alternatives to unhealthy solutions, etc.);

TOPICS AND METHODS EXPLORED TO AN EXTENT OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS :

- the insufferable nature of Wine and Winetricks (esp. on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS) 
- the benefits of using make/Makefile over a project-building script
- x86 assembly :
  - choosing the architecture ( i286, i386/elf32/x86, elf64/x64 )
  - choosing the assembler
  - choosing the right syntax
  - choosing a CC or the linker AND writing the correct tags for the command

- (TBA)

Planned projects for the future : 
- helping to maintain [the Linux kernel, systemd, 0AD video game, Pop!_OS kernel, coreboot codebase, etc.]

CHOSEN PERSONAL PROJECT:
__________________________________________________________________________

- Just A GAME FOR DOSBOX is fine.
- own package -or- release / command.

> -
- a virtual machine,
- an emulator,
- or a video game that poses as an operating system (a la Last Call BBS).
  - Can I use the Unity Engine for that?
  - research dedicated toolchains. 
- challenge: faithful resolution
- plan of attack:
  - fide: 320x200
  - now: 1920x1200, 6 times both ways.
  - consider fair, authentic scaling. 
- learn BIOS-kernel-API/DSP-distro ladder for that 
- An API / display server protocol for a 13h-like mode portable to any headless system.
