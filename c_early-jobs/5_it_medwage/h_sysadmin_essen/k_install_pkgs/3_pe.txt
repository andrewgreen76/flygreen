INSTALLATION EXECUTABLES IN WINDOWS GUI
===================================================================================

Flavors of executables:
 (a) files that use an MSI file to guide the GUI Windows installer (wizard) to correctly install something
      . the system assumes certain settings by default
 (b) independent custom installers, having nothing to do with an .msi file or the Windows installer and just
     running point on everything
      . you will have to define every little detail for the installation process


Microsoft’s portable executable (PE):
 . a format of an executable native to Windows
 . tells Windows installer about the ***resources*** needed for the setup and ***bootstraps*** the Windows installer
 . wraps in : 
   . the application itself
   . the application’s dependencies
   . code / data
   . regular text (e.g., comments)
   . other resources (embedded image data, icon data) - under the resources section (.rsrc) 
   . (MSI file)
   => “self-contained”
   . (a header with metadata)


Windows installer bootstrapping: 
 . the triggered PE will in turn trigger, pass its own resources, and then pass control to (bootstrap) the
   Windows installer
