 . port number 123
 (a) local NTP server
 (b) public NTP server
 . When connecting computers with NTP clients to the same network, you tell them which NTP server they are to synchronize their clocks to.
 . “It’s better to connect many NTP clients to a local server to reduce external network traffic, improve synchronization accuracy, and lessen the load on public servers.”
 . Connecting NTP clients to their local NTP server and connecting that server to a public NTP server is also a good idea.
