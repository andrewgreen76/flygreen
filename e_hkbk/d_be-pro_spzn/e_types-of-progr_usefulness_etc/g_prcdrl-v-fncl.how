Certainly! Here's a classic example of a simple task implemented in both procedural and functional programming styles:

Procedural Programming (using C-like syntax):
```c
// Procedural Programming Example (C)
#include <stdio.h>

int calculateSum(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    int x = 5;
    int y = 3;
    int sum = calculateSum(x, y);
    printf("The sum of %d and %d is %d\n", x, y, sum);
    return 0;
}
```

Functional Programming (using a JavaScript-like syntax):
```javascript
// Functional Programming Example (JavaScript)
function calculateSum(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

const x = 5;
const y = 3;
const sum = calculateSum(x, y);
console.log(`The sum of ${x} and ${y} is ${sum}`);
```

In the procedural programming example, the code is organized around procedures or functions. It defines a function `calculateSum` that takes two parameters and returns their sum. The main function declares variables `x` and `y`, calls the `calculateSum` function, and prints the result using `printf` (C) or `console.log` (JavaScript).

In the functional programming example, the code focuses on the evaluation of expressions and avoids mutable state. The `calculateSum` function is a pure function that takes two parameters and returns their sum. The `const` keyword is used to declare variables `x`, `y`, and `sum`. The result is logged to the console using `console.log`.

The procedural programming style is centered around a sequence of steps and mutable state, while the functional programming style emphasizes the evaluation of functions and immutable data.
