Turing(-complete) machine :
 . can do lots of things - more than a calculator
 . can process conditions 


===================================================================================
TURING MACHINE 
===================================================================================

 . an abstract model of "the perfect machine" 
 |
 + infinite resources
    + infinite amount of memory (tape)
    + infinite amount of time to compute 
    . Processing takes time , so the output is NOT immediate.     
    => needs enough time and memory to solve any one particular problem 
 . I/O medium : read/write head 
 + logic - rules to execute - algorithm - processing abilities :
    . TM has "the perfect algorithm" that can help solve (just about) any problem. 
       . there are problems that are unsolveable 
    . able to perform general-purpose computations - beyond arithmetic functions
       . exponentiation , root extraction , and logarithm are "in a grey area" 
    . the ability to check for conditions
    . the ability to jump on a condition (exclusively conditional branching)
       . no unconditional branching 

"
In mathematics, exponentiation (power) is an arithmetic operation on numbers. It can be thought of as
  repeated multiplication, just as multiplication can be thought of as repeated addition.
