CPU caches are integrated onto the same die as the CPU (Central Processing Unit) rather than being separate components on the motherboard. The integration of caches on the CPU die is designed to reduce the latency in accessing frequently used data and instructions, improving overall processing speed.

There are typically multiple levels of cache, often referred to as L1, L2, and sometimes L3 caches:

1. **L1 Cache:** This is the smallest but fastest cache and is often split into separate instruction and data caches. L1 caches are directly integrated into the CPU cores.

2. **L2 Cache:** Larger than the L1 cache, the L2 cache is shared among the CPU cores in a multi-core processor. In some architectures, each core may have its own L2 cache.

3. **L3 Cache:** In some processors, there is an additional level of cache known as L3 cache, which is shared across all CPU cores.

Having these caches integrated on the CPU die reduces the time it takes for the CPU to fetch data and instructions from memory. The on-die integration minimizes the distance that data needs to travel, leading to lower latency and faster access times compared to fetching data from the main system memory (RAM).

The cache hierarchy and organization can vary between different CPU architectures and models, but the integration of caches directly onto the CPU die is a common design principle for modern processors.
