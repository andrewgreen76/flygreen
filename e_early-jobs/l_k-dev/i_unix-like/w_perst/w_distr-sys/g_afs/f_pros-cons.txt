========================================================================================

Pros :

  |
  + strong security :
     . user authentication
     . user-controlled access (privacy settings , incl. per-file)
	. (access-control lists)



Cons :
  |
  - not an open standard (compared to NFS)
     . seriously losing the battle to NFS and CIFS (the Windows-based Common Internet File System)
     . NFSv4 is the closest thing to AFS
