What is an .ini file? And what is the [LocalizedFileNames] tag for?
ChatGPT

An .ini file, short for initialization file, is a plain text configuration file used to store settings and preferences for software applications. It typically consists of sections, keys, and values.

The [LocalizedFileNames] tag is specific to Windows operating systems and is used in certain .ini files, such as desktop.ini files, to specify localized names for files or folders. This tag is used to provide localized display names for files and folders in different languages or locales. It allows the operating system to display appropriate names based on the user's language settings.
