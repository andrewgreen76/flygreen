The go-to method for emulating a chip today is using FPGA-based emulation, where a chip's design is implemented on an FPGA using HDL (like Verilog or VHDL) and synthesized with tools like Xilinx Vivado or Intel Quartus to replicate the chip's behavior for testing and verification.

... an FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) can be used to emulate a chip by configuring its programmable logic to replicate the behavior and functionality of a specific integrated circuit or processor, often for testing or prototyping purposes.

While emulating chips is a use case, the primary purpose of an FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) is to provide flexible, reconfigurable hardware for implementing custom digital circuits, prototyping designs, or accelerating specific tasks in applications like signal processing, machine learning, or embedded systems.
