Let’s dive into the etymology of "PB" in the context of the ATtiny85’s schematic, breaking it down step-by-step to clarify why it’s called Port B and why there’s no Port A.
Step 1: Understanding "Port" in Microcontrollers

    A port in a microcontroller like the ATtiny85 is a group of pins used for input/output (I/O) operations, such as reading digital signals, outputting voltages, or handling special functions like PWM or SPI.
    The term "port" comes from computer engineering, where it refers to a set of pins or registers acting as an interface for data transfer, analogous to a "port" in a harbor where goods (data) enter or leave.

Step 2: The AVR Architecture and Naming Convention

    The ATtiny85 is part of the AVR microcontroller family, developed by Atmel (now part of Microchip Technology).
    In AVR architecture, I/O pins are grouped into ports, and each port is assigned a letter (e.g., A, B, C) to identify it in schematics, datasheets, and code.
    The letter designation (like "B" in PB) is a convention rooted in the AVR’s design history, where ports are labeled alphabetically to distinguish multiple sets of I/O pins on larger chips.

Step 3: Why "PB" for ATtiny85?

    PB stands for Port B, where the "P" denotes "Port" and "B" indicates the specific port, in this case, the second port in the alphabetical naming scheme (A, B, C, etc.).
    The ATtiny85 has 6 I/O pins (PB0 to PB5), all grouped under Port B, as defined in its hardware design.
    The "B" is simply a label chosen by Atmel to identify this port. It doesn’t inherently mean "second port" in a functional sense but follows the AVR convention where ports are labeled starting from A, B, C, and so on, depending on the chip’s complexity.

Step 4: Why No "Port A" on ATtiny85?

    The ATtiny85 is a compact, 8-pin microcontroller with limited resources (1 KB flash, 64 bytes EEPROM, 32 registers, no SRAM).
    Due to its small pin count, it only needs one I/O port, which Atmel designated as Port B (PB0 to PB5, with 6 pins: 5 general-purpose I/O and 1 input-only).
    Port A is absent because the ATtiny85 doesn’t have enough pins to warrant a second port. Larger AVR microcontrollers, like the ATmega328P (used in Arduino Uno), have multiple ports (e.g., Port A, Port B, Port C, Port D) because they have more pins (28 or 32) to support additional I/O groups.
    The choice of "B" over "A" for the ATtiny85’s single port is likely a historical or design consistency decision by Atmel, aligning with other AVR chips where Port B is commonly used for core I/O functions. It’s not that Port A "exists but is missing"; it was never implemented due to the chip’s minimal design.

Step 5: Etymology of "PB"

    The "P" in PB is an abbreviation for Port, a term borrowed from electronics and computing to describe an interface for data exchange.
    The "B" is an arbitrary alphabetical identifier within the AVR family’s naming scheme, likely chosen to maintain consistency with other AVR microcontrollers where Port B is a standard I/O port. There’s no definitive public record explaining why Atmel skipped "A" for the ATtiny85, but it’s plausible they reserved "A" for potential future expansion or to align with naming patterns in larger AVR chips (e.g., ATtiny26 has both Port A and Port B).
    The naming convention traces back to the early days of microcontroller design, where manufacturers like Atmel, Intel, or Motorola used letters to label ports (e.g., Intel 8051 also uses Port 0, Port 1, etc.), a practice rooted in organizing hardware registers clearly for programmers and engineers.

Step 6: Practical Context in ATtiny85

    In the ATtiny85 schematic, PB0 to PB5 refer to specific pins (e.g., physical pins 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 1 on the 8-pin DIP package).
    These pins are controlled via Port B registers (e.g., PORTB for output, PINB for input, DDRB for direction) in AVR programming.
    The "PB" label is used in datasheets, schematics, and code to indicate these pins belong to Port B, making it clear which register set controls them.

Why the Confusion?

    The absence of Port A can seem odd because we expect alphabetical sequences to start with "A." However, in microcontrollers, port naming is often chip-specific and doesn’t always follow a strict "A first" rule, especially in minimal designs like the ATtiny85.
    For comparison, other small AVR chips like the ATtiny11 also use only Port B, while larger ones (e.g., ATmega328P) use multiple ports starting from A or B, depending on the chip’s pinout and features.

Summary
The PB in ATtiny85’s schematic stands for Port B, where "P" means Port (an interface for I/O) and "B" is an alphabetical label chosen by Atmel for the chip’s single I/O port, with no Port A implemented due to the ATtiny85’s limited 8-pin design and minimal I/O requirements. The naming reflects AVR’s convention for organizing ports, rooted in microcontroller design practices from the 1980s onward.
