The system clock speed of the ATtiny85 (set to 8 MHz for this project) governs the processor's overall operation, while the I2C bus speed (typically 400 kHz for the SSD1306 OLED display) determines the data transfer rate between the ATtiny85 and the display.
"


"
The 400 kHz I2C bus speed is regulated by the ATtiny85's internal I2C hardware (TWI module), which uses the 8 MHz system clock as a reference to generate the I2C clock signal, configured via software settings in the Tiny4kOLED library.
"


"
The ATtiny85's Two-Wire Interface (TWI) module generates the 400 kHz I2C bus clock by dividing the 8 MHz system clock and manages data transfer with the SSD1306 OLED display through a master-slave protocol, handling start/stop conditions, addressing, and data transmission/reception, as configured by the Tiny4kOLED library.
