REST is an architectural style used in web services and APIs to design networked applications. It was introduced by Roy Fielding in his doctoral dissertation in 2000 and has become widely adopted as a standard for building scalable, efficient, and interoperable web services.

REST is based on a set of principles and constraints that aim to provide a simple and standardized way to interact with resources over the web. Key principles of REST include:

1. Stateless: Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. The server should not store any client state between requests.

2. Client-Server: The client and server are separate entities that interact with each other through a standardized interface. This separation allows them to evolve independently and promotes scalability.

3. Uniform Interface: REST uses a uniform set of standard methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform actions on resources. Each resource is uniquely identified using URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers).

4. Cacheability: Responses from the server can be marked as cacheable or non-cacheable, allowing clients to reuse previously obtained data, reducing the need for frequent requests.

5. Layered System: REST allows for the use of a layered system architecture, where each component (e.g., client, server, proxy) is unaware of the existence of other components. This promotes scalability and simplifies maintenance.

RESTful APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) adhere to the principles of REST architecture, making them easy to consume and integrate into various client applications. They are widely used in web development, cloud services, mobile applications, and other distributed systems to facilitate communication and data exchange between different systems.
