Two purposes of a transistor :
 . (in analog circuits) amplifier - regulated by the base terminal 
 . (in digital circuits) switch - when the base changes from 0V to about 0.7V , the drain/emitter switches from 0 to 1 
    . technically an amplifier ; you just bypass the gradation between 0V and 0.7V 

"
Engineers switched from relays to transistors because transistors are smaller, FASTER, MORE RELIABLE,
CONSUME LESS POWER, and ENABLE COMPACT, HIGH-SPEED ELECTRONIC CIRCUITS, unlike bulky, slow, and power-hungry
mechanical relays.
"

Not all transistors are alike. Two common types :
 . BJT - "used in modern electronics for applications like amplification, switching, and high-current circuits
       	  due to their robustness and linear characteristics"
 . MOSFET - "higher switching speeds, lower power consumption due to voltage-driven rather than current-driven
   	     operation, smaller size, and better efficiency in digital and high-frequency circuits"
