Every HDD has a disk scheduling algorithm.
 |
 |
 . FIFO
 |
 . Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF)
 |  . prime sort : by tracks , inside-out or outside-in 
 |  . per-track sort : clockwise
 |
 . SCAN (Elevator)
 |  . the arm moves back and forth to service the closest job in the queue 
 |
 . Shortest Access Time First (SATF)
    . jobs are sorted by their access times ( T(I/O) ) 
    . T(I/O) is quickly computed for sorting and scheduling
    . the disk scheduler does the calculations 
       . part of the kernel's I/O subsystem ...
       . ... while the action is happening in the disk drive
