Is Mandrake headless?
ChatGPT

Mandrake Linux was a Linux distribution that was active from 1998 to 2005. It later merged with Connectiva Linux to form Mandriva Linux. Like most Linux distributions, Mandrake/Mandriva had the flexibility to be installed and used in various configurations, including headless setups.

A headless system refers to a computer or device that operates without a dedicated monitor, keyboard, or mouse, typically controlled remotely. Whether Mandrake/Mandriva was headless or not would depend on how it was installed and configured by the user. It could be set up as a headless server or a desktop system with graphical capabilities, depending on the specific needs and preferences of the user.
