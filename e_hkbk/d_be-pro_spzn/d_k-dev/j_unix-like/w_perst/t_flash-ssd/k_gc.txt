GARBAGE COLLECTION : 
==========================================================================================

At the time of reaching a dead block :
  . live pages are searched for
 -> live pages are buffered
 -> dead block is erased
 -> the block is refreshed with the recent content
 -> the less recent block of the live pages is released 


Relieving a block of dead weight means :
 - more operations on the blocks (erase at old block , write at new block) 
   => more wear



We want to relieve the SSD of block op work.
|
Over-provisioning :
  . An SSD can be designed and developed to have extra storage just for live pages.
  . Cleaning is deferred until downtime. 
 -> During downtime GC can do its work and live pages can be moved onto the freshest locations.
 => GC over the same blocks is less frequent.
